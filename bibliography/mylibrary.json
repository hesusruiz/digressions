  {"id":"AbrahamEtAl2013","abstract":"We do a game-theoretic analysis of leader election, under the assumption that each agent prefers to have some leader than to have no leader at all. We show that it is possible to obtain a fair Nash equilibrium, where each agent has an equal probability of being elected leader, in a completely connected network, in a bidirectional ring, and a unidirectional ring, in the synchronous setting. In the asynchronous setting, Nash equilibrium is not quite the right solution concept. Rather, we must consider ex post Nash equilibrium; this means that we have a Nash equilibrium no matter what a scheduling adversary does. We show that ex post Nash equilibrium is attainable in the asynchronous setting in all the networks we consider, using a protocol with bounded running time. However, in the asynchronous setting, we require that n > 2. We can get a fair -Nash equilibrium if n = 2 in the asynchronous setting, under some cryptographic assumptions (speciﬁcally, the existence of a pseudo-random number generator and polynomially-bounded agents), using ideas from bit-commitment protocols. We then generalize these results to a setting where we can have deviations by a coalition of size k. In this case, we can get what we call a fair k-resilient equilibrium if n > 2k; under the same cryptographic assumptions, we can a get a k-resilient equilibrium if n = 2k. Finally, we show that, under minimal assumptions, not only do our protocols give a Nash equilibrium, they also give a sequential equilibrium [Kreps and Wilson 1982], so players even play optimally off the equilibrium path.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Abraham","given":"Ittai"},{"family":"Dolev","given":"Danny"},{"family":"Halpern","given":"Joseph Y."}],"collection-editor":[{"family":"Hutchison","given":"David"},{"family":"Kanade","given":"Takeo"},{"family":"Kittler","given":"Josef"},{"family":"Kleinberg","given":"Jon M."},{"family":"Mattern","given":"Friedemann"},{"family":"Mitchell","given":"John C."},{"family":"Naor","given":"Moni"},{"family":"Nierstrasz","given":"Oscar"},{"family":"Pandu Rangan","given":"C."},{"family":"Steffen","given":"Bernhard"},{"family":"Sudan","given":"Madhu"},{"family":"Terzopoulos","given":"Demetri"},{"family":"Tygar","given":"Doug"},{"family":"Vardi","given":"Moshe Y."},{"family":"Weikum","given":"Gerhard"}],"container-title":"Distributed Computing","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-642-41527-2_5","editor":[{"family":"Afek","given":"Yehuda"}],"ISBN":"978-3-642-41526-5 978-3-642-41527-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","page":"61-75","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher-place":"Berlin, Heidelberg","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Distributed Protocols for Leader Election: A Game-Theoretic Perspective","title-short":"Distributed Protocols for Leader Election","type":"chapter","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-642-41527-2_5","volume":"8205"},

In such environments, protocols must tolerate both Byzantine behaviors when broken, misconﬁgured, or malicious nodes arbitrarily deviate from their speciﬁcation and rational behaviors when selﬁsh nodes deviate from their speciﬁcation to increase their local beneﬁt. The paper makes three contributions: (1) It introduces the BAR (Byzantine, Altruistic, Rational) model as a foundation for reasoning about cooperative services; (2) It proposes a general three-level architecture to reduce the complexity of building services under the BAR model; and (3) It describes an implementation of BAR-B, the ﬁrst cooperative backup service to tolerate both Byzantine users and an unbounded number of rational users. At the core of BAR-B is an asynchronous replicated state machine that provides the customary safety and liveness guarantees despite nodes exhibiting both Byzantine and rational behaviors.

  {"id":"Al-BassamEtAl2018","abstract":"Light clients, also known as Simple Payment Verification (SPV) clients, are nodes which only download a small portion of the data in a blockchain, and use indirect means to verify that a given chain is valid. Typically, instead of validating block data, they assume that the chain favoured by the blockchain's consensus algorithm only contains valid blocks, and that the majority of block producers are honest. By allowing such clients to receive fraud proofs generated by fully validating nodes that show that a block violates the protocol rules, and combining this with probabilistic sampling techniques to verify that all of the data in a block actually is available to be downloaded, we can eliminate the honest-majority assumption, and instead make much weaker assumptions about a minimum number of honest nodes that rebroadcast data. Fraud and data availability proofs are key to enabling on-chain scaling of blockchains (e.g. via sharding or bigger blocks) while maintaining a strong assurance that on-chain data is available and valid. We present, implement, and evaluate a novel fraud and data availability proof system.","author":[{"family":"Al-Bassam","given":"Mustafa"},{"family":"Sonnino","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Buterin","given":"Vitalik"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,9]]},"title":"Fraud Proofs: Maximising Light Client Security and Scaling Blockchains with Dishonest Majorities","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09044"},

Distributed transactions are often rejected as an undesirable tradeoff today, but in the absence of transactions there are few concrete principles or tools to help programmers design and verify the correctness of their applications. We address this situation with the CALM principle, which con- nects the idea of distributed consistency to program tests for logical monotonicity. We then introduce Bloom, a distributed programming language that is amenable to high-level consistency analysis and encourages order-insensitive programming. We present a prototype implementation of Bloom as a domain-specific language in Ruby. We also propose a program analysis technique that identifies points of order in Bloom programs: code locations where programmers may need to inject coordination logic to ensure consistency.

  {"id":"AnceaumeEtAl2017","abstract":"Distributed Ledgers (e.g. Bitcoin) occupy currently the first lines of the economical and political media and many speculations are done with respect to their level of coherence and their computability power. \nInterestingly, there is no consensus on the properties and abstractions that fully capture the behaviour of distributed ledgers. The interest in formalising the behaviour of distributed ledgers is twofold. Firstly, it helps to prove the correctness of the algorithms that implement existing distributed ledgers and explore their limits with respect to an unfriendly environment and target applications.\n%\nSecondly, it facilitates the identification of  the minimal building blocks necessary to implement the distributed ledger  in a specific environment. \n\nEven though the behaviour of distributed ledgers is similar to abstractions that have been deeply  studied for decades in distributed systems  no abstraction is sufficiently powerful to capture the distributed ledger behaviour.\n\nThis paper introduces the Distributed Ledger Register, a register  that mimics the behaviour of one of the most popular distributed ledger, i.e. the Bitcoin ledger. The aim of our work is to provide formal guarantees on the coherent evolution of Bitcoin. We furthermore show that the Bitcoin blockchain maintenance algorithm verifies the distributed ledger register properties under strict conditions.

  {"id":"AntaEtAl2018","abstract":"Despite the hype about blockchains and distributed ledgers, no formal abstraction of these objects has been proposed. To face this issue, in this paper we provide a proper formulation of a distributed ledger object. In brief, we define a ledger object as a sequence of records, and we provide the operations and the properties that such an object should support. Implementation of a ledger object on top of multiple (possibly geographically dispersed) computing devices gives rise to the distributed ledger object. In contrast to the centralized object, distribution allows operations to be applied concurrently on the ledger, introducing challenges on the consistency of the ledger in each participant. We provide the definitions of three well known consistency guarantees in terms of the operations supported by the ledger object: (1) atomic consistency (linearizability), (2) sequential consistency, and (3) eventual consistency. We then provide implementations of distributed ledgers on asynchronous message passing crash-prone systems using an Atomic Broadcast service, and show that they provide eventual, sequential or atomic consistency semantics. We conclude with a variation of the ledger - the validated ledger - which requires that each record in the ledger satisfies a particular validation rule.","author":[{"family":"Anta","given":"Antonio Fernández"},{"family":"Georgiou","given":"Chryssis"},{"family":"Konwar","given":"Kishori"},{"family":"Nicolaou","given":"Nicolas"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,2]]},"title":"Formalizing and Implementing Distributed Ledger Objects","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07817"},
  {"id":"AntaEtAl2018a","abstract":"The various applications using Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) or blockchains, have led to the introduction of a new `marketplace' where multiple types of digital assets may be exchanged. As each blockchain is designed to support specific types of assets and transactions, and no blockchain will prevail, the need to perform interblockchain transactions is already pressing. In this work we examine the fundamental problem of interoperable and interconnected blockchains. In particular, we begin by introducing the Multi-Distributed Ledger Objects (MDLO), which is the result of aggregating multiple Distributed Ledger Objects -- DLO (a DLO is a formalization of the blockchain) and that supports append and get operations of records (e.g., transactions) in them from multiple clients concurrently. Next, we define the AtomicAppends problem, which emerges when the exchange of digital assets between multiple clients may involve appending records in more than one DLO. Specifically, AtomicAppend requires that either all records will be appended on the involved DLOs or none. We examine the solvability of this problem assuming rational and risk-averse clients that may fail by crashing, and under different client utility and append models, timing models, and client failure scenarios. We show that for some cases the existence of an intermediary is necessary for the problem solution. We propose the implementation of such intermediary over a specialized blockchain, we term Smart DLO (SDLO), and we show how this can be used to solve the AtomicAppends problem even in an asynchronous, client competitive environment, where all the clients may crash.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Anta","given":"Antonio Fernandez"},{"family":"Georgiou","given":"Chryssis"},{"family":"Nicolaou","given":"Nicolas"}],"container-title":"arXiv:1812.08446 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,12,20]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Atomic Appends: Selling Cars and Coordinating Armies with Multiple Distributed Ledgers","title-short":"Atomic Appends","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08446"},
  {"id":"AntoniadisEtAl2018","abstract":"Consensus and State Machine Replication (SMR) are generally considered to be equivalent problems. In certain system models, indeed, the two problems are computationally equivalent: any solution to the former problem leads to a solution to the latter, and vice versa. In this paper, we study the relation between consensus and SMR from a complexity perspective. We ﬁnd that, surprisingly, completing an SMR command can be more expensive than solving a consensus instance. Speciﬁcally, given a synchronous system model where every instance of consensus always terminates in constant time, completing an SMR command does not necessarily terminate in constant time. This result naturally extends to partially synchronous models. Besides theoretical interest, our result also corresponds to practical phenomena we identify empirically. We experiment with two well-known SMR implementations (Multi-Paxos and Raft) and show that, indeed, SMR is more expensive than consensus in practice. One important implication of our result is that – even under synchrony conditions – no SMR algorithm can ensure bounded response times.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Antoniadis","given":"Karolos"},{"family":"Guerraoui","given":"Rachid"},{"family":"Malkhi","given":"Dahlia"},{"family":"Seredinschi","given":"Dragos-Adrian"}],"DOI":"10.4230/LIPICS.DISC.2018.7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","page":"18 pages","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"State Machine Replication Is More Expensive Than Consensus","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2018/9796/"},

  {"id":"ArnoldEtAl2017","abstract":"Blockchain technology has the potential to radically alter the way enterprises conduct business as well as the way institutions process transactions. Businesses and governments often operate in isolation but with blockchain technology participants can engage in business transactions with customers, suppliers, regulators, potentially spanning across geographical boundaries. Blockchain technology, at its core, features an immutable distributed ledger, a decentralized network that is cryptographically secured. Blockchain architecture gives participants the ability to share a ledger, through peer to peer replication, which is updated every time a block of transaction(s) is agreed to be committed. The technology can reduce operational costs and friction, create transaction records that are immutable, and enable transparent ledgers where updates are nearly instantaneous. It may also dramatically change the way workflow and business procedures are designed inside an enterprise and open up new opportunities for innovation and growth. Blockchain technology can be viewed from a business, legal and technical perspective: • From a business perspective, blockchain is an exchange network that facilitates transfer of value, assets, or other entities between willing and mutually agreeing participants, ensuring privacy and control of data to stakeholders • From a legal perspective, blockchain ledger transactions are validated, indisputable transactions, which do not require intermediaries or trusted third-party legal entities. • From a technical perspective, blockchain is a replicated, distributed ledger of transactions with ledger entries referencing other data stores (for additional information related to ledger transactions). Cryptography is used to ensure that network participants see only the parts of the ledger that are relevant to them, and that transactions are secure, authenticated and verifiable, in the context of permissioned business blockchains. This document will introduce basic blockchain concepts that define a standard reference architecture that can be used in creating blockchain applications. Blockchain Fundamentals A blockchain is a shared ledger distributed across a business network. Business transactions are permanently recorded in append-only blocks to the ledger. All the consensually confirmed and validated transaction blocks are linked from the genesis block to the most current block with each block linked to its previous block using the cryptographic hash of the previous block -hence the name blockchain.","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"page":"18","title":"Cloud customer architecture for enterprise social collaboration","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cloud-council.org/deliverables/CSCC-Cloud-Customer-Architecture-for-Blockchain.pdf%0Ahttp://www.cloud-council.org/deliverables/CSCC-Cloud-Customer-Architecture-for-Enterprise-Social-Collaboration.pdf"},

  {"id":"AublinEtAl2013","abstract":"Byzantine Fault Tolerant state machine replication (BFT) protocols are replication protocols that tolerate arbitrary faults of a fraction of the replicas. Although significant efforts have been recently made, existing BFT protocols do not provide acceptable performance when faults occur. As we show in this paper, this comes from the fact that all existing BFT protocols targeting high throughput use a special replica, called the primary, which indicates to other replicas the order in which requests should be processed. This primary can be smartly malicious and degrade the performance of the system without being detected by correct replicas. In this paper, we propose a new approach, called RBFT for Redundant-BFT: we execute multiple instances of the same BFT protocol, each with a primary replica executing on a different machine. All the instances order the requests, but only the requests ordered by one of the instances, called the master instance, are actually executed. The performance of the different instances is closely monitored, in order to check that the master instance provides adequate performance. If that is not the case, the primary replica of the master instance is considered malicious and replaced. We implemented RBFT and compared its performance to that of other existing robust protocols. Our evaluation shows that RBFT achieves similar performance as the most robust protocols when there is no failure and that, under faults, its maximum performance degradation is about 3%, whereas it is at least equal to 78% for existing protocols.","author":[{"family":"Aublin","given":"Pierre-Louis"},{"family":"Mokhtar","given":"Sonia Ben"},{"family":"Quéma","given":"Vivien"}],"DOI":"10.1109/ICDCS.2013.53","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"title":"RBFT: Redundant Byzantine Fault Tolerance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pakupaku.me/plaublin/rbft/5000a297.pdf"},

The guifi.net community network is a successful example of a digital infrastructure, a computer network, managed as an open commons.

In this paper, we explore the feasibility and sustainability of community clouds as open commons: open user-driven clouds formed by community-managed computing resources. We propose organising the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) cloud service layers as common-pool resources (CPR) for enabling a sustainable cloud service provision. On this basis, we have outlined a governance framework for community clouds, and we have developed Cloudy, a cloud software stack that comprises a set of tools and components to build and operate community cloud services. Cloudy is tailored to the needs of the guifi.net community network, but it can be adopted by other communities. We have validated the feasibility of community clouds in a deployment in guifi.net of some 60 devices running Cloudy for over two years. To gain insight into the capacity of end-user services to generate enough value and utility to sustain the whole cloud ecosystem, we have developed a file storage application and tested it with a group of 10 guifi.net users.

  {"id":"BissoliDamore2018","abstract":"We present a practical methodology for securing the classical password-based authentication scheme, since in many cases this type of authenti-cation is given as a requirement. We propose a solution based on the well-known (k, n) threshold scheme of Shamir for sharing a secret, where in our case the secret is the password itself and (k, n) threshold scheme means that n password-derived secrets (shares) are created and k ≤ n shares are necessary and sufficient for reconstructing the password, while k − 1 are not sufficient. The scheme is information-theoretic secure. Since each of the n shares is stored on a different host (shareholder), an attacker will need to compromise k different shareholders for obtaining an amount of data sufficient for reconstructing the secret. Furthermore, in order to be resistant to the compromising of the server (dealer) coordinating the shareholders we define a variant of the classic Shamir, where the Shamir's abscissae are unknown to dealer and shareholders, making the reconstruction impossible even in the case of dealer and shareholders compromised. In addition we use the Pedersen technique for allowing the verification of shares. For the described scenario we have designed two protocols allowing the communication between application, dealer and shareholders, so that the relevant players can participate to the phases of registration (user's sign-up, to be carried out once), and of authentication (user's login). We analyse several scenarios where dealer and/or shareholders are par-tially/totally compromised and confirm that none of them is enabling the attacker to break the authentication. Furthermore we focus on cases where one or more byzantine servers are presented, analysing the impact on the framework and show the adopted mechanisms to be safe against these kinds of attacks. We have developed a prototype demonstrating that our framework works correctly, effectively and efficiently. It provides a first feasibility study that will provide a base for structured and engineered cloud-based implementations aiming at providing an authentication-as-a-service.","author":[{"family":"Bissoli","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"D'amore","given":"Fabrizio"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"title":"Authentication as a service: Shamir Secret Sharing with byzantine components","type":"report"},

  {"id":"BonnetRaynal2008","abstract":"This paper addresses the consensus problem in asynchronous systems prone to process crashes, where additionally the processes are anonymous (they cannot be distinguished one from the other: they have no name and execute the same code). To circumvent the three computational adversaries (asynchrony, failures and anonymity) each process is provided with a failure detector ofa class denoted ψ, that gives it an upper bound on the number of processes that are currently alive (in a non-anonymous system, the classes ψ and P -the class of perfect failure detectors- are equivalent). The paper first presents a simple ψ-based consensus algorithm where the processes decide in 2t + 1 asynchronous rounds (where t is an upper bound on the number of faulty processes). It then shows one of its main results, namely, 2t + 1 is a lower bound for consensus in the anonymous systems equipped with ψ. The second contribution addresses early-decision. The paper presents and proves correct an early-deciding algorithm where the processes decide in min(2f + 2, 2t + 1) asynchronous rounds (where f is the actual number of process failures). This leads to think that anonymity doubles the cost (wrt synchronous systems) and it is conjectured that min(2f + 2, 2t + 1) is the corresponding lower bound. The paper finally considers the k-set agreement problem in anonymous systems. It first shows that the previous ψ-based consensus algorithm solves the k-set agreement problem in Rt = 2? t k ? +1 asynchronous rounds. Then, considering a family offailure detector classes {ψ?}1≤?≤k that generalizes the class ψ(= ψ1), the paper presents an algorithm that solves the k-set agreement in Rt,? = 2? t k−?+1?+1 asynchronous rounds.

Considering an asynchronous message-passing system of n processes where (a) up to t \\textless n/3 may commit Byzantine failures, and (b) each pair of processes is connected by two uni-directional channels (with possibly different timing properties), this paper investigates the synchrony assumption required to solve consensus, and presents a signature-free consensus algorithm whose synchrony requirement is the existence of a process that is an eventual t + 1bisource. Such a process p is a correct process that eventually has (a) timely input channels from t correct processes and (b) timely output channels to t correct processes (these input and output channels can connect p to different subsets of processes). As this synchrony condition was shown to be necessary and sufficient in the stronger asynchronous system model (a) enriched with message authentication, and (b) where the channels are bidirectional and have the same timing properties in both directions, it follows that it is also necessary and sufficient in the weaker system model considered in the paper. In addition to the fact that it closes a long-lasting problem related to Byzantine agreement, a noteworthy feature of the proposed algorithm lies in its design simplicity, which is a first-class property.","author":[{"family":"Bouzid","given":"Zohir"},{"family":"Mostéfaoui","given":"Achour"},{"family":"Raynal","given":"Michel"}],"DOI":"10.1145/2767386.2767418","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"page":"461–470","title":"Minimal Synchrony for Byzantine Consensus Minimal Synchrony for Asynchronous Byzantine Consensus","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01178651"},
  {"id":"BrandenburgerEtAl2018","abstract":"A smart contract on a blockchain cannot keep a secret because its data is replicated on all nodes in a network. To remedy this problem, it has been suggested to combine blockchains with trusted execution environments (TEEs), such as Intel SGX, for executing applications that demand privacy. As a consequence untrusted blockchain nodes cannot get access to the data and computations inside the TEE. This paper first explores some pitfalls that arise from the combination of TEEs with blockchains. Since smart contracts executed inside TEEs are, in principle, stateless they are susceptible to roll-back attacks, which should be prevented to maintain privacy for the application. However, in blockchains with non-final consensus protocols, such as the proof-of-work in Ethereum and others, the contract execution must handle rollbacks by design. This implies that TEEs for securing blockchain execution cannot be directly used for such blockchains; this approach works only when the consensus decisions are final. Second, this work introduces an architecture and a prototype for smart-contract execution within Intel SGX technology for Hy-perledger Fabric, a prominent enterprise blockchain platform. Our system resolves difficulties posed by the execute-order-validate architecture of Fabric, prevents rollback attacks on TEE-based execution as far as possible, and minimizes the trusted computing base. For increasing security, our design encapsulates each application on the blockchain within its own enclave that shields it from the host system. An evaluation shows that the overhead moving execution into SGX is within 10%-20% for a sealed-bid auction application.","author":[{"family":"Brandenburger","given":"Marcus"},{"family":"Cachin","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Kapitza","given":"Rüdiger"},{"family":"Sorniotti","given":"Alessandro"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"title":"Blockchain and Trusted Computing: Problems, Pitfalls, and a Solution for Hyperledger Fabric","type":"report","URL":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08541"},

Proof generation and verification times are linear in n. Bulletproofs greatly improve on the linear (in n) sized range proofs currently used to implement Confidential Transactions (CT) in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Moreover, Bulletproofs supports aggregation of range proofs, so that a party can prove that m commitments lie within a given range by providing only an additive Oplogpmqq group elements over the length of a single proof. To aggregate proofs from multiple parties, we enable the parties to generate a single proof without revealing their inputs to each other via a simple multi-party computation (MPC) protocol for constructing Bulletproofs. This MPC protocol uses either a constant number of rounds and linear communication, or a logarithmic number of rounds and logarithmic communication.

Today a variety of solution to this problem exist, each optimized for particular execution conditions. Given that, in most cases, real systems operate under dynamic conditions, it is important to develop mechanisms that allow the algorithms to be adapted or changed at runtime to optimize the system to the current conditions. The problem of dynamic adaptation of consensus algorithms is not new, but the literature is scarce for the Byzantine case and there is no comprehensive comparison of existing solutions. This work has two complementary objectives. First, it studies how the different dynamic adaptation techniques proposed for the crash failure model can be applied in the presence of Byzantine faults. Second, it presents a comparative study of the performance of these switching algorithms in practice. For that purpose, we have implemented the switching algorithms in a common software framework, based on the open source BFT-SMaRt library.

Software bugs, operator mistakes, and malicious attacks are a major cause of service interruptions and they can cause arbitrary behavior , that is, Byzantine faults. This article describes a new replication algorithm, BFT, that can be used to build highly available systems that tolerate Byzantine faults. BFT can be used in practice to implement real services: it performs well, it is safe in asynchronous environments such as the Internet, it incorporates mechanisms to defend against Byzantine-faulty clients, and it recovers replicas proactively. The recovery mechanism allows the algorithm to tolerate any number of faults over the lifetime of the system provided fewer than 1/3 of the replicas become faulty within a small window of vulnerability. BFT has been implemented as a generic program library with a simple interface. We used the library to implement the first Byzantine-fault-tolerant NFS file system, BFS. The BFT library and BFS perform well because the library incorporates several important optimizations, the most important of which is the use of symmetric cryptography to authenticate messages. The performance results show that BFS performs 2% faster to 24% slower than production implementations of the NFS protocol that are not replicated. This supports our claim that the BFT library can be used to build practical systems that tolerate Byzantine faults.","author":[{"family":"Castro","given":"Miguel"},{"family":"Liskov","given":"Barbara"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2002]]},"number":"4","page":"398–461","title":"Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance and Proactive Recovery","type":"report","URL":"http://www.pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/bft-tocs.pdf"},

To the best of our knowledge, the present survey, which can also be used as a tutorial, fills this void. In particular, we systematize three aspects of Ethereum systems security: vulnerabilities, attacks, and defenses.

As opposed to previous algorithms that cannot terminate in the presence of a faulty or slow coordinator, our algorithm can terminate even when its coordinator is faulty, hence the name weak coordinator.

The resulting algorithm assumes partial synchrony, is resilience optimal, time optimal and does not need signatures. Our presentation is didactic: we first present a simple safe binary Byzantine consensus algorithm, modify it to ensure termination, and finally present an optimized reduction from multivalue consensus to binary consensus that may terminate in 4 message delays. To evaluate our algorithm, we deployed it on 100 machines distributed in 5 datacenters across different continents and compared its performance against the randomized solution from Mostefaoui, Moumem and Raynal [PODC14] that terminates in O(1) rounds in expectation. Our algorithm always outperforms the latter even in the presence of Byzantine behaviors.

To achieve scalability across servers in more than 10 countries located on 4 different continents, we drastically revisited Byzantine fault tolerant blockchains and verification of signatures. The resulting blockchain, called the Red Belly Blockchain (RBBC), commits more than a hundred thousand transactions issued by permissionless nodes. These transactions are grouped into blocks within few seconds through a partially synchronous consensus run by permissioned nodes. It prevents double spending by guaranteeing that a unique block is decided at any given index of the chain in a deterministic way by all participants. We compared the performance of RBBC against traditional Byzantine fault tolerant alternatives and more recent randomized solutions. In the same geo-distributed environment with low-end machines, we noticed two interesting comparisons: (i) the RBBC throughput scales to hundreds of machines whereas the classic 3-step leader-based BFT state machine used by consortium blockchains cannot scale to 40 identically configured nodes; (ii) RBBC guarantees transaction finality in 3 seconds and experiences a third of the latency that randomized-based solutions like HoneyBadgerBFT can offer.

It relies on a peer-to-peer network and cryptographic protocols to perform the functions of traditional financial intermediaries, such as verifying transactions and preserving the integrity of the system. This article examines the political economy of Bitcoin, in light of a recent dispute that divided the Bitcoin community with regard to a seemingly simple technical issue: whether or not to increase the block size of the Bitcoin blockchain. By looking at the socio-technical constructs of Bitcoin, the article distinguishes between two distinct coordination mechanisms: governance by the infrastructure (achieved via the Bitcoin protocol) and governance of the infrastructure (managed by the community of developers and other stakeholders). It then analyses the invisible politics inherent in these two mechanisms, which together display a highly technocratic power structure. On the one hand, as an attempt to be self-governing and self-sustaining, the Bitcoin network exhibits a strong market-driven approach to social trust and coordination, which has been embedded directly into the technical protocol. On the other hand, despite being an open source project, the development and maintenance of the Bitcoin code ultimately relies on a small core of highly skilled developers who play a key role in the design of the platform. Teaser: As a trustless technology, Bitcoin tries to solve issues of social coordination and economic exchange by relying, only and exclusively, on technological means. Yet, when looking deeper into the governance structure of this technology, it becomes apparent that technology alone is unable to resolve most of the social and political concerns affecting the Bitcoin network.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"De Filippi","given":"Primavera"},{"family":"Loveluck","given":"Benjamin"}],"container-title":"Internet Policy Review","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,9]]},"source":"HAL Archives Ouvertes","title":"The invisible politics of Bitcoin: governance crisis of a decentralised infrastructure","title-short":"The invisible politics of Bitcoin","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01382007"},
  {"id":"delaVegaEtAl2018","abstract":"Modern IoT deployments do require considerable investments that might only be justified if the data being gathered could be monetized, which leads to the need for a digital data marketplace. In many cases, the provider of the IoT data needs to process it locally for data curation, aggregation, stream processing, etc. At the same time, the consumer could be interested in nearby data. This scenario resembles a fog computing architecture where companies require being able, keeping data under their control, to securely make it available to other companies in a peer-to-peer fashion, without needing a cloud intermediary (like traditional marketplaces do), thus maximizing the locality of the processing and avoiding the existence of a bottleneck when the intermediary makes the data delivery for accounting purposes. Nevertheless, this imposes a hard requirement: by not having a central marketplace, the peers (seller and customer) need to trust each other, which, in turn, requires enforcing a nonrepudiation schema. In this paper, the authors propose a distributed peer-to-peer architecture for such a data marketplace that takes advantage of the architectural fundamentals of fog computing, in which data processing, filtering, and stream based event generation is done in a fog node along with the data, and where relationships, both commercial agreements and data delivery, are performed directly between producers and consumers without the need of mutual trust thanks to the usage of blockchain principles (e.g., distributed ledger, consensus mechanism). The proposed architecture is validated through a case study involving a set of key issues regarding nonrepudiation commonly identified when moving from a centralized marketplace to a distributed one. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed solution does not bring in any limitation with regard to a centralized marketplace solution, in terms of pricing models (subscriptions, pay-per-use, etc.) or usage conditions (contract duration, updates rate, etc.).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Vega","given":"Francisco","non-dropping-particle":"de la"},{"family":"Soriano","given":"Javier"},{"family":"Jimenez","given":"Miguel"},{"family":"Lizcano","given":"David"}],"container-title":"Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing","container-title-short":"Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing","DOI":"10.1155/2018/5758741","ISSN":"1530-8669, 1530-8677","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,4]]},"language":"en","page":"1-15","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A Peer-to-Peer Architecture for Distributed Data Monetization in Fog Computing Scenarios","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/wcmc/2018/5758741/","volume":"2018"},

This problem is relevant to critical applications that rely on the combination of the opinions of multiple peers to provide a service. Examples include monitoring a content source to prevent equivocation or to track variability in the content provided, and resolving divergent state amongst the nodes of a distributed system. Previous works assume a fully synchronous system, where one can make strong assumptions such as negligible message delivery delays and/or detection of absent messages. However, practical, real-world systems are mostly asynchronous, i.e., they exhibit only some periods of synchrony during which message delivery is timely, thus requiring a different approach. In this paper, we present a thorough study on practical interactive consistency. We leverage the vast prior work on broadcast and byzantine consensus algorithms to design, implement and evaluate a set of algorithms, with varying timing assumptions and message complexity, that can be used to achieve interactive consistency in real-world distributed systems. We provide a complete, open-source implementation of each proposed interactive consistency algorithm by building a multi-layered stack of protocols that include several broadcast protocols, as well as a binary and a multi-valued consensus protocol. Most of these protocols have never been implemented and evaluated in a real system before. We analyze the performance of our suite of algorithms experimentally by engaging in both single instance and multiple parallel instances of each alternative.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Diamantopoulos","given":"Panos"},{"family":"Maneas","given":"Stathis"},{"family":"Patsonakis","given":"Christos"},{"family":"Chondros","given":"Nikos"},{"family":"Roussopoulos","given":"Mema"}],"container-title":"arXiv:1410.7256 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,10,27]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Interactive Consistency in practical, mostly-asynchronous systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.7256"},

  {"id":"DinhEtAl2017","abstract":"Blockchain technologies are taking the world by storm. Public blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, enable secure peer-to-peer applications like crypto-currency or smart contracts. Their security and performance are well studied. This paper concerns recent private blockchain systems designed with stronger security (trust) assumption and performance requirement. These systems target and aim to disrupt applications which have so far been implemented on top of database systems, for example banking, finance applications. Multiple platforms for private blockchains are being actively developed and fine tuned. However, there is a clear lack of a systematic framework with which different systems can be analyzed and compared against each other. Such a framework can be used to assess blockchains' viability as another distributed data processing platform, while helping developers to identify bottlenecks and accordingly improve their platforms. In this paper, we first describe BlockBench, the first evaluation framework for analyzing private blockchains. It serves as a fair means of comparison for different platforms and enables deeper understanding of different system design choices. Any private blockchain can be integrated to BlockBench via simple APIs and benchmarked against workloads that are based on real and synthetic smart contracts. BlockBench measures overall and component-wise performance in terms of throughput, latency, scalability and fault-tolerance. Next, we use BlockBench to conduct comprehensive evaluation of three major private blockchains: Ethereum, Parity and Hyperledger Fabric. The results demonstrate that these systems are still far from displacing current database systems in traditional data processing workloads. Furthermore, there are gaps in performance among the three systems which are attributed to the design choices at different layers of the software stack.","author":[{"family":"Dinh","given":"Tien Tuan Anh"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Ji"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Gang"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Rui"},{"family":"Ooi","given":"Beng Chin"},{"family":"Tan","given":"Kian-Lee"}],"DOI":"10.1145/3035918.3064033","ISSN":"16130073","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"PMID":"18187073","title":"BLOCKBENCH: A Framework for Analyzing Private Blockchains","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04057"},
  {"id":"DinhEtAl2018","abstract":"Blockchain technologies are gaining massive momentum in the last few years. Blockchains are distributed ledgers that enable parties who do not fully trust each other to maintain a set of global states. The parties agree on the existence, values and histories of the states. As the technology landscape is expanding rapidly, it is both important and challenging to have a firm grasp of what the core technologies have to offer, especially with respect to their data processing capabilities. In this paper, we first survey the state of the art, focusing on private blockchains (in which parties are authenticated). We analyze both in-production and research systems in four dimensions: distributed ledger, cryptography, consensus protocol and smart contract. We then present BLOCKBENCH, a benchmarking framework for understanding performance of private blockchains against data processing workloads. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of three major blockchain systems based on BLOCKBENCH, namely Ethereum, Parity and Hyperledger Fabric. The results demonstrate several trade-offs in the design space, as well as big performance gaps between blockchain and database systems. Drawing from design principles of database systems, we discuss several research directions for bringing blockchain performance closer to the realm of databases.","author":[{"family":"Dinh","given":"Tien Tuan Anh"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Rui"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Meihui"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Gang"},{"family":"Ooi","given":"Beng Chin"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Ji"}],"container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","DOI":"10.1109/TKDE.2017.2781227","ISSN":"10414347","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"page":"1366–1385","title":"Untangling Blockchain: A Data Processing View of Blockchain Systems","type":"article-journal","volume":"30"},

In addition to the overhead for BFT protocol and state-machine replication, this practice degrades performance and prevents throughput scalability. In this paper, we propose an extension to existing BFT architectures that increases performance for the default number of replicas by optimizing the resource utilization of their execution stages. Our approach executes a request on only a selected subset of replicas, using a selector component co-located with each replica. As this leads to divergent replica states, a selector on-demand updates outdated objects on the local replica prior to processing a request. Our evaluation shows that with each replica executing only a part of all requests, the overall performance of a Byzantine fault-tolerant NFS can be almost doubled; our prototype even outperforms unreplicated NFS.","author":[{"family":"Distler","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Kapitza","given":"Rüdiger"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the sixth conference on Computer systems - EuroSys '11","DOI":"10.1145/1966445.1966455","ISSN":"18618200","issue":"July","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"page":"91","title":"Increasing performance in byzantine fault-tolerant systems with on-demand replica consistency","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1966445.1966455"},

Implementations proposed in the literature so far have relied on state machine replication and reach agreement on each individual set element in sequence. We introduce set-union consensus, a specialization of Byzantine consensus that reaches agreement over whole sets. This primitive admits an efficient and simple implementation by the composition of Eppstein's set reconciliation protocol with Ben-Or's ByzConsensus protocol. A free software implementation of this construction is available in GNUnet. Experimental results indicate that our approach results in an efficient protocol for very large sets, especially in the absence of Byzantine faults.

  {"id":"DongEtAl2018","abstract":"Off-chain scaling techniques allow mutually distrustful parties to execute a contract locally among themselves instead of on the global blockchain. Parties involved in the transaction maintain a multi-signature fraud-proof off-chain replicated state machine, and only resort to on-chain consensus when absolutely necessary (e.g., when two parties disagree on a state). Off-chain scaling is the only way to support fully scale-out decentralized applications (\"dApps\") with better privacy and no compromise on the trust and decentralization guarantees. It is the inflection point for blockchain mass adoption, and will be the engine behind all scalable dApps. Celer Network is an Internet-scale, trust-free, and privacy-preserving platform where everyone can quickly build, operate, and use highly scalable dApps. It is not a standalone blockchain but a networked system running on top of existing and future blockchains. It provides unprecedented performance and flexibility through innovation in off-chain scaling techniques and incentive-aligned cryptoeconomics. Celer Network embraces a layered architecture with clean abstractions that enable rapid evolution of each individual component, including a generalized state channel and sidechain suite that supports fast and generic off-chain state transitions; a provably optimal value transfer routing mechanism that achieves an order of magnitude higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art solutions; a powerful development framework and runtime for off-chain applications; and a new cryptoeconomic model that provides network effect, stable liquidity, and high availability for the off-chain ecosystem.","author":[{"family":"Dong","given":"Mo"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Qingkai"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xiaozhou"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Junda"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,9]]},"title":"Celer Network: Bring Internet Scale to Every Blockchain","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00037"},

BC has the potential to overcome security and privacy challenges of Internet of Things (IoT). However, BC is computationally expensive, has limited scalability and incurs significant bandwidth overheads and delays which are not suited to the IoT context. We propose a tiered Lightweight Scalable BC (LSB) that is optimized for IoT requirements. We explore LSB in a smart home setting as a representative example for broader IoT applications. Low resource devices in a smart home benefit from a centralized manager that establishes shared keys for communication and processes all incoming and outgoing requests. LSB achieves decentralization by forming an overlay network where high resource devices jointly manage a public BC that ensures end-to-end privacy and security. The overlay is organized as distinct clusters to reduce overheads and the cluster heads are responsible for managing the public BC. LSB incorporates several optimizations which include algorithms for lightweight consensus, distributed trust and throughput management. Qualitative arguments demonstrate that LSB is resilient to several security attacks. Extensive simulations show that LSB decreases packet overhead and delay and increases BC scalability compared to relevant baselines.","author":[{"family":"Dorri","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Kanhere","given":"Salil S"},{"family":"Jurdak","given":"Raja"},{"family":"Gauravaram","given":"Praveen"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"title":"LSB: A Lightweight Scalable BlockChain for IoT Security and Privacy","type":"report","URL":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.02969.pdf"},

The constellations considered distinguish different roles of processes, such that we can directly derive a meaningful bound on the time complexity of implementing robust general services using several replicas coordinated through consensus.

Partial synchrony lies between the cases of a synchronous system and an asynchronous system. In a synchronous system, there is a known fixed upper bound A on the time required for a message to be sent from one processor to another and a known fixed upper bound % on the relative speeds of different processors. In an asynchronous system no fixed upper bounds A and @ exist. In one version of partial synchrony, fixed bounds A and Cp exist, but they are not known a priori. The problem is to design protocols that work correctly in the partially synchronous system regardless of the actual values of the bounds A and Cp. In another version of partial synchrony, the bounds are known, but are only guaranteed to hold starting at some unknown time T, and protocols must be designed to work correctly regardless of when time T occurs. Fault-tolerant consensus protocols are given for various cases of partial synchrony and various fault models. Lower bounds that show in most cases that our protocols are optimal with respect to the number of faults tolerated are also given. Our consensus protocols for partially synchronous processors use new protocols for fault-tolerant “distributed clocks” that allow partially synchronous processors to reach some approximately common notion of time.

We present an attack with which colluding miners obtain a revenue larger than their fair share. This attack can have significant consequences for Bitcoin: Rational miners will prefer to join the selfish miners, and the colluding group will increase in size until it becomes a majority. At this point, the Bitcoin system ceases to be a decentralized currency.\nUnless certain assumptions are made, selfish mining may be feasible for any group size of colluding miners. We propose a practical modification to the Bitcoin protocol that protects Bitcoin in the general case. It prohibits selfish mining by pools that command less than \\(1/4\\) of the resources.

  {"id":"FlorianoEtAl2017","abstract":"Conceptually, tuple spaces are shared memory objects that provide operations to store and retrieve ordered sets of data, called tuples. Tuples stored in a tuple space are accessed by the contents of their fields, working as an associative memory. Although there are some proposals for secure tuple spaces, accessing tuples through field contents makes these systems susceptible to attacks that could impair user and data privacy, since servers must access tuple data. In order to deal with these limitations and provide privacy in the tuple space model, this paper proposes some extensions to DepSpace, a tuple space system that implements dependability and security properties through a set of mechanisms that are not enough to ensure privacy. The resulting system provides privacy and, at the same time, allows tuple selection/matches similar to the traditional insecure model, i.e., it does not constraint the matching possibilities. The main problem to be addressed is that servers must select tuples based on their contents without knowing them. The proposed solution uses robust cryptographic schemes, as order-preserving encryption and homomorphic encryption, to provide this functionality without revealing the tuple contents. An analysis concerning security aspects of DepSpace is presented, as well as the benefits of the proposed solutions. A set of experiments, executed with an implementation of the proposed protocols, shows the feasibility of the proposed solutions and shed some light on both the behavior of the system and the costs to provide privacy in the tuple spaces model.","author":[{"family":"Floriano","given":"Edson"},{"family":"Alchieri","given":"Eduardo"},{"family":"Aranha","given":"Diego F."},{"family":"Solis","given":"Priscila"}],"container-title":"Journal of Internet Services and Applications","DOI":"10.1186/s13174-017-0070-3","ISSN":"1867-4828","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,12]]},"page":"19","title":"Providing privacy on the tuple space model","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://jisajournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13174-017-0070-3","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"FrohlichEtAl2018","abstract":"Wireless sensor networks, often adhering to a single gateway architecture, constitute the communication backbone for many modern cyber-physical systems. Consequently, faulttolerance in CPS becomes a challenging task, especially when accounting for failures (potentially malicious) that incapacitate the gateway or disrupt the nodes-gateway communication, not to mention the energy, timeliness, and security constraints demanded by CPS domains. This paper aims at ameliorating the fault-tolerance of WSN based CPS to increase system and data availability. To this end, we propose a replicated gateway architecture augmented with energy-efﬁcient real-time Byzantineresilient data communication protocols. At the sensors level, we introduce FT-TSTP, a geographic routing protocol capable of delivering messages in an energy-efﬁcient and timely manner to multiple gateways, even in the presence of voids caused by faulty and malicious sensor nodes. At the gateway level, we propose a multi-gateway synchronization protocol, which we call ByzCast, that delivers timely correct data to CPS applications, despite the failure or maliciousness of a number of gateways. We show, through extensive simulations, that our protocols provide better system robustness yielding an increased system and data availability while meeting CPS energy, timeliness, and security demands.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Frohlich","given":"Antonio A."},{"family":"Scheffel","given":"Roberto M."},{"family":"Kozhaya","given":"David"},{"family":"Verissimo","given":"Paulo E."}],"container-title":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","DOI":"10.1109/JIOT.2018.2871157","ISSN":"2327-4662, 2372-2541","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","page":"1-1","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Byzantine Resilient Protocol for the IoT","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8468005/"},
  {"id":"GarayEtAl2014","abstract":"Bitcoin is the first and most popular decentralized cryptocurrency to date. In this work, we extract and analyze the core of the Bitcoin protocol, which we term the Bitcoin backbone, and prove two of its fundamental properties which we call common prefix and chain quality in the static setting where the number of players remains fixed. Our proofs hinge on appropriate and novel assumptions on the hashing power of the adversary relative to network synchronicity; we show our results to be tight under high synchronization. Next, we propose and analyze applications that can be built on top of the backbone protocol, specifically focusing on Byzantine agreement (BA) and on the notion of a public transaction ledger. Regarding BA, we observe that Nakamoto's suggestion falls short of solving it, and present a simple alternative which works assuming that the adversary's hashing power is bounded by 1/3. The public transaction ledger captures the essence of Bitcoin's operation as a cryptocurrency, in the sense that it guarantees the liveness and persistence of committed transactions. Based on this notion we describe and analyze the Bitcoin system as well as a more elaborate BA protocol, proving them secure assuming high network synchronicity and that the adversary's hashing power is strictly less than 1/2, while the adversarial bound needed for security decreases as the network desynchronizes. Finally, we show that our analysis of the Bitcoin backbone protocol for synchronous networks extends with relative ease to the recently considered partially synchronous model, where there is an upper bound in the delay of messages that is unknown to the honest parties.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Garay","given":"Juan"},{"family":"Kiayias","given":"Aggelos"},{"family":"Leonardos","given":"Nikos"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"number":"765","source":"ePrint IACR","title":"The Bitcoin Backbone Protocol: Analysis and Applications","title-short":"The Bitcoin Backbone Protocol","type":"report","URL":"http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/765"},

One of the main issues in consensus research is the many different variants of the problem that exist as well as the various ways the problem behaves when different setup, computational assumptions and network models are considered. In this work we perform a systematization of knowledge in the landscape of consensus research starting with the original formulation in the early 1980s up to the present blockchain-based new class of consensus protocols.

Unfortunately, the theoretical foundations underlying such blockchains have not been thoroughly investigated. To close this gap, in this paper we study decentralised quorum construction by means of federated Byzantine quorum systems, used by Stellar. We rigorously prove the correctness of basic broadcast abstractions over federated quorum systems and establish their relationship to the classical Byzantine quorum systems. In particular, we prove correctness in the realistic setting where Byzantine nodes may lie about their trust choices. We show that this setting leads to a novel variant of Byzantine quorum systems where different nodes may have different understanding of what constitutes a quorum.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,13]]},"author":[{"family":"García-Pérez","given":"Álvaro"},{"family":"Gotsman","given":"Alexey"}],"container-title":"arXiv:1811.03642 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,8]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Federated Byzantine Quorum Systems (Extended Version)","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03642"},

Therefore, their design should include improved resilience capabilities to allow them to operate correctly in highly adverse environments. This paper proposes SieveQ, a message queue service that protects and regulates the access to critical systems, in a way similar to an application-level firewall. SieveQ achieves fault and intrusion tolerance by employing an architecture based on two filtering layers, enabling efficient removal of invalid messages at early stages and decreasing the costs associated with Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) replication of previous solutions. Our experimental evaluation shows that SieveQ improves existing replicated-firewalls resilience in the presence of corrupted messages by faulty nodes.

The key challenge here is how to ensure replicas fail independently, i.e., avoid that a single attack compromises more than f replicas at once. The obvious answer for this is the use of diverse replicas, but most works in BFT simply assume such diversity without supporting mechanisms to substantiate this assumption. Lazarus is a control plane for managing the deployment and execution of diverse replicas in BFT systems. Lazarus continuously monitors the current vulnerabilities of the system replicas (reported in security feeds such as NVD and ExploitDB) and employs a metric to measure the risk of having a common weakness in the replicas set. If such risk is high, the set of replicas is reconfigured. Our evaluation shows that the devised strategy reduces the number of executions where the system becomes compromised and that our prototype supports the execution of full-fledged BFT systems in diverse configurations with 17 OS versions, reaching a performance close to a homogeneous bare-metal setup.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Garcia","given":"Miguel"},{"family":"Bessani","given":"Alysson"},{"family":"Neves","given":"Nuno"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the 20th International Middleware Conference on   - Middleware '19","DOI":"10.1145/3361525.3361550","event":"the 20th International Middleware Conference","ISBN":"978-1-4503-7009-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"241-254","publisher":"ACM Press","publisher-place":"Davis, CA, USA","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Lazarus: Automatic Management of Diversity in BFT Systems","title-short":"Lazarus","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3361525.3361550"},

Lately, the Byzantine failure model has been used in the area of network security where Byzantine-tolerance is equated with resilience against malicious attackers. We discuss two reasons why one should be careful in doing so. Firstly, Byzantine-tolerance is not concerned with secrecy and so special means have to be employed if secrecy is a desired system property. Secondly, in contrast to the domain of hardware faults, in a security setting it is difﬁcult to compute the assumption coverage of the Byzantine failure model, i.e., the probability that the failure assumption holds in practice.

To sustain its correct operation in spite of its ever-increasing use, Bitcoin implements a number of necessary optimizations and scalability measures. These measures limit the amount of information broadcast in the system to the minimum necessary. In this paper, we show that current scalability measures adopted by Bitcoin come at odds with the security of the system. More specifically, we show that an adversary can exploit these measures in order to effectively delay the propagation of transactions and blocks to specific nodes—without causing a network partitioning in the system. We show that this allows the adversary to easily mount Denial-of-Service attacks, considerably increase its mining advantage in the network, and double-spend transactions in spite of the current countermeasures adopted by Bitcoin.

Therefore, we first define a set of fundamental constraints that digital identity systems must satisfy to preserve and promote privacy as required for individual autonomy. With these constraints in mind, we then propose a decentralised, standards-based approach, using a combination of distributed ledger technology and thoughtful regulation, to facilitate many-to-many relationships among providers of key services. Our proposal for digital identity differs from others in its approach to trust in that we do not seek to bind credentials to each other or to a mutually trusted authority to achieve strong non-transferability.

To cover worst-case situations, our abstraction enables to use in AZyzzyva any existing BFT protocol, typically, a classical one like PBFT which has been tested and proved correct. We then present Aliph, a new BFT protocol that outperforms previous BFT protocols both in terms of latency (by up to 30%) and throughput (by up to 360%).

  {"id":"GuerraouiEtAl2019","abstract":"Many blockchain-based algorithms, such as Bitcoin, implement a decentralized asset transfer system, often referred to as a cryptocurrency. As stated in the original paper by Nakamoto, at the heart of these systems lies the problem of preventing double-spending; this is usually solved by achieving consensus on the order of transfers among the participants. In this paper, we treat the asset transfer problem as a concurrent object and determine its consensus number, showing that consensus is, in fact, not necessary to prevent double-spending. We first consider the problem as defined by Nakamoto, where only a single process---the account owner---can withdraw from each account. Safety and liveness need to be ensured for correct account owners, whereas misbehaving account owners might be unable to perform transfers. We show that the consensus number of an asset transfer object is $1$. We then consider a more general $k$-shared asset transfer object where up to $k$ processes can atomically withdraw from the same account, and show that this object has consensus number $k$. We establish our results in the context of shared memory with benign faults, allowing us to properly understand the level of difficulty of the asset transfer problem. We also translate these results in the message passing setting with Byzantine players, a model that is more relevant in practice. In this model, we describe an asynchronous Byzantine fault-tolerant asset transfer implementation that is both simpler and more efficient than state-of-the-art consensus-based solutions. Our results are applicable to both the permissioned (private) and permissionless (public) setting, as normally their differentiation is hidden by the abstractions on top of which our algorithms are based.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Guerraoui","given":"Rachid"},{"family":"Kuznetsov","given":"Petr"},{"family":"Monti","given":"Matteo"},{"family":"Pavlovic","given":"Matej"},{"family":"Seredinschi","given":"Dragos-Adrian"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the 2019 ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing - PODC '19","DOI":"10.1145/3293611.3331589","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"307-316","source":"arXiv.org","title":"The Consensus Number of a Cryptocurrency (Extended Version)","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05574"},

  {"id":"GunnEtAl2019","abstract":"Consensus mechanisms used by popular distributed ledgers are highly scalable but notoriously inefficient. Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) protocols are efficient but far less scalable. Speculative BFT protocols such as Zyzzyva and Zyzzyva5 are efficient and scalable but require a trade-off: Zyzzyva requires only $3f + 1$ replicas to tolerate $f$ faults, but even a single slow replica will make Zyzzyva fall back to more expensive non-speculative operation. Zyzzyva5 does not require a non-speculative fallback, but requires $5f + 1$ replicas in order to tolerate $f$ faults. BFT variants using hardware-assisted trusted components can tolerate a greater proportion of faults, but require that every replica have this hardware. We present SACZyzzyva, addressing these concerns: resilience to slow replicas and requiring only $3f + 1$ replicas, with only one replica needing an active monotonic counter at any given time. We experimentally evaluate our protocols, demonstrating low latency and high scalability. We prove that SACZyzzyva is optimally robust and that trusted components cannot increase fault tolerance unless they are present in greater than two-thirds of replicas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Gunn","given":"Lachlan J."},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jian"},{"family":"Vavala","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Asokan","given":"N."}],"container-title":"arXiv:1905.10255 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,24]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Making Speculative BFT Resilient with Trusted Monotonic Counters","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10255"},
  {"id":"GuptaEtAl2019","abstract":"Since the inception of Bitcoin, the distributed and database community has shown interest in the design of efficient blockchain systems. At the core of any blockchain application is a Byzantine-Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocol that helps a set of replicas reach an agreement on the order of a client request. Initial blockchain applications (like Bitcoin) attain very low throughput and are computationally expensive. Hence, researchers moved towards the design of permissioned blockchain systems that employ classical BFT protocols, such as PBFT, to reach consensus. However, existing permissioned blockchain systems still attain low throughputs (of the order 10K txns/s). As a result, existing works blame this low throughput on the associated BFT protocol and expend resources in developing optimizes protocols. We believe such blames only depict a one-sided story. In specific, we raise a simple question: can a well-crafted system based on a classical BFT protocol outperform a modern protocol? We show that designing such a well-crafted system is possible and illustrate cases where a three-phase protocol can outperform a single-phase protocol. Further, we dissect a permissioned blockchain system and state several factors that affect its performance. We also design a high-throughput yielding permissioned blockchain system, ResilientDB, that employs parallel pipelines to balance tasks at a replica, and provides guidelines for future designs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Gupta","given":"Suyash"},{"family":"Rahnama","given":"Sajjad"},{"family":"Sadoghi","given":"Mohammad"}],"container-title":"arXiv:1911.09208 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,20]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Permissioned Blockchain Through the Looking Glass: Architectural and Implementation Lessons Learned","title-short":"Permissioned Blockchain Through the Looking Glass","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09208"},

Unfortunately, tolerating arbitrary faults, also known as Byzantine faults, poses several challenges to system designers, often limiting performance, requiring additional hardware, or both. This dissertation presents new protocols that provide substantially better performance than previously demonstrated. The Byzantine fault-tolerant erasure-coded block storage protocol proposed in this thesis provides 40% higher write throughput than the best prior approach. The Byzantine fault-tolerant replicated state machine provides a factor of 2.2-2.9 times higher throughput than the best prior approach. Furthermore, the protocols presented in this dissertation require 25-33% fewer responsive servers than the nearest competitors. To enable these results, this dissertation introduces several new techniques, including homomorphic fingerprinting, partial encoding, and Byzantine Locking, that provide unprecedented scalability, higher throughput, lower latency, and lower computational overhead. This dissertation also considers new methods for analyzing the correctness of distributed systems in the presence of faulty clients. Distributed services and storage systems built using these techniques can provide Byzantine fault tolerance in a more efficient, higher performance, and more scalable manner than previously thought possible.","author":[{"family":"Hendricks","given":"James"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"Efficient Byzantine Fault Tolerance for Scalable Storage and Services","type":"thesis"},

Our false friends attack exploits the Kademlia-inspired peer discovery logic used by Geth and enables a low-resource eclipsing of long-running, remote victim nodes. An adversary only needs two hosts in distinct /24 subnets to launch the eclipse, which can then be leveraged to filter the victim's view of the Blockchain.

Transactions are simultaneously secure and trustworthy due to the use of cryptographic principles. In recent years, blockchain technology has become very trendy and penetrated different domains, mostly due to the popularity of cryptocurrencies. One field where blockchain technology has tremendous potential is healthcare, due to the need for a more patient-centric approach to healthcare systems and to connect disparate systems and increase the accuracy of electronic healthcare records (EHRs). In this systematic review, an analysis of state-of-the-art blockchain research in the field of healthcare is conducted. The aim is to reveal the potential applications of the technology and to highlight the challenges and possible directions of blockchain research in healthcare. First, background information is discussed, followed by a description of the exact methodology used in this paper. Next, an analysis of the results is given, which includes a bibliometric overview, an analysis of gathered data and its properties, and the results of a literature quality assessment. Lastly, there is a discussion of the results from the analysis. The findings indicate that blockchain technology research in healthcare is increasing and it is mostly used for data sharing, managing health records and access control. Other scenarios are very rare. Most research is aimed at presenting novel structural designs in the form of frameworks, architectures or models. Findings also show that technical details about the used blockchain elements are not given in most of the analyzed publications and that most research does not present any prototype implementation or implementation details. Often even with a prototype implementation, no details about blockchain elements are given.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Hölbl","given":"Marko"},{"family":"Kompara","given":"Marko"},{"family":"Kamišalić","given":"Aida"},{"family":"Nemec Zlatolas","given":"Lili"}],"container-title":"Symmetry","DOI":"10.3390/sym10100470","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,10]]},"language":"en","page":"470","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"A Systematic Review of the Use of Blockchain in Healthcare","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/10/10/470","volume":"10"},

Yet, this paradigm continuously suffers from numerous security and privacy concerns mainly due to its massive scale, distributed nature, and scarcity of resources towards the edge of IoT networks. Interestingly, blockchain based techniques offer strong countermeasures to protect data from tampering while supporting the distributed nature of the IoT. However, the enormous amount of energy consumption required to verify each block of data make it difficult to use with resource-constrained IoT devices and with real-time IoT applications. Nevertheless, it can expose the privacy of the stakeholders due to its public ledger system even though it secures data from alterations. Edge computing approaches suggest a potential alternative to centralized processing in order to populate real-time applications at the edge and to reduce privacy concerns associated with cloud computing. Hence, this paper suggests the novel privacy preserving blockchain called TrustChain which combines the power of blockchains with trust concepts to eliminate issues associated with traditional blockchain architectures. This work investigates how TrustChain can be deployed in the edge computing environment with different levels of absorptions to eliminate delays and privacy concerns associated with centralized processing and to preserve the resources in IoT networks.","author":[{"family":"Jayasinghe","given":"Upul"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Gyu Myoung"},{"family":"MacDermott","given":"Áine"},{"family":"Rhee","given":"Woo Seop"}],"container-title":"Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing","DOI":"10.1155/2019/2014697","editor":[{"family":"Elgazzar","given":"Khalid"}],"ISSN":"1530-8669","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,8]]},"page":"2014697","title":"TrustChain: A Privacy Preserving Blockchain with Edge Computing","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/2014697","volume":"2019"},
  {"id":"JimenezPerisEtAl2017","abstract":"Companies have evolved from a world where they only had SQL databases to a world where they use different kinds of data stores, such as key­value data stores, document­oriented data stores and graph databases. The reason why they have started to introduce this diversity of persistency models is because different NoSQL technologies bring different data models with associated query languages and/or APIs. However, they are confronted now with a problem in which they have the data scattered across different data stores. This problem lies in that when a business action requires to update the data, the data reside in different data stores, and they are subject to inconsistencies in the event of failure and/or concurrent access. These inconsistencies appear due to the lack of transactional consistency that was guaranteed in traditional SQL databases but is not guaranteed either within the NoSQL data stores or across data stores and databases. CoherentPaaS comes to remedy this need. CoherentPaaS provides an ultra­scalable transactional management layer that can be integrated with any data store with multi­ versioning capabilities. The layer has been integrated with six different data stores, three NoSQL data stores and three SQL­like databases.

  {"id":"KapitzaEtAl2012","abstract":"One of the main reasons why Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) systems are not widely used lies in their high resource consumption: 3f+1 replicas are necessary to tolerate only f faults. Recent works have been able to reduce the minimum number of replicas to 2f+1 by relying on a trusted subsystem that prevents a replica from making conflicting statements to other replicas without being detected. Nevertheless, having been designed with the focus on fault handling, these systems still employ a majority of replicas during normal-case operation for seemingly redundant work. Furthermore, the trusted subsystems available trade off performance for security; that is, they either achieve high throughput or they come with a small trusted computing base. This paper presents CheapBFT, a BFT system that, for the first time, tolerates that all but one of the replicas active in normal-case operation become faulty. CheapBFT runs a composite agreement protocol and exploits passive replication to save resources; in the absence of faults, it requires that only f+1 replicas actively agree on client requests and execute them. In case of suspected faulty behavior, CheapBFT triggers a transition protocol that activates f extra passive replicas and brings all non-faulty replicas into a consistent state again. This approach, for example, allows the system to safely switch to another, more resilient agreement protocol. CheapBFT relies on an FPGA-based trusted subsystem for the authentication of protocol messages that provides high performance and comprises a small trusted computing base.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Kapitza","given":"Rüdiger"},{"family":"Behl","given":"Johannes"},{"family":"Cachin","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Distler","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Kuhnle","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Mohammadi","given":"Seyed Vahid"},{"family":"Schröder-Preikschat","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Stengel","given":"Klaus"}],"collection-title":"EuroSys '12","container-title":"Proceedings of the 7th ACM European Conference on Computer Systems","DOI":"10.1145/2168836.2168866","event-place":"Bern, Switzerland","ISBN":"978-1-4503-1223-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"page":"295–308","publisher":"ACM","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"CheapBFT: Resource-efficient Byzantine Fault Tolerance","title-short":"CheapBFT","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2168836.2168866"},
  {"id":"KarakostasEtAl2019","abstract":"Since the invention of Bitcoin one decade ago, numerous cryptocurrencies have sprung into existence. Among these, proof-of-work is the most common mechanism for achieving consensus, whilst a number of coins have adopted “ASIC-resistance” as a desirable property, claiming to be more “egalitarian,” where egalitarianism refers to the power of each coin to participate in the creation of new coins. While proof-of-work consensus dominates the space, several new cryptocurrencies employ alternative consensus, such as proof-of-stake in which block minting opportunities are based on monetary ownership. A core criticism of proof-of-stake revolves around it being less egalitarian by making the rich richer, as opposed to proof-of-work in which everyone can contribute equally according to their computational power. In this paper, we give the ﬁrst quantitative deﬁnition of a cryptocurrency’s egalitarianism. Based on our deﬁnition, we measure the egalitarianism of popular cryptocurrencies that (may or may not) employ ASIC-resistance, among them Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero. Our simulations show, as expected, that ASIC-resistance increases a cryptocurrency’s egalitarianism. We also measure the egalitarianism of a stake-based protocol, Ouroboros, and a hybrid proof-of-stake/proof-of-work cryptocurrency, Decred. We show that stake-based cryptocurrencies, under correctly selected parameters, can be perfectly egalitarian, perhaps contradicting folklore belief.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Karakostas","given":"Dimitris"},{"family":"Kiayias","given":"Aggelos"},{"family":"Nasikas","given":"Christos"},{"family":"Zindros","given":"Dionysis"}],"container-title":"arXiv:1907.02434 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,4]]},"language":"en","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Cryptocurrency Egalitarianism: A Quantitative Approach","title-short":"Cryptocurrency Egalitarianism","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02434"},

In that vein, blockchain may be a suitable complement to ontologies to achieve a big part of the vision of the semantic Web by Tim Berners-Lee. We believe that if this complementarity is to be achieved blockchain and ontologies must co-evolve. In this paper, we focus on what and how to engineer models, methods, designs, and implementations for this co-evolution. As a first step in this co-evolution, we propose a conceptual design of a governance ontology represented as meta-data tags to be embedded and instantiated in a smart contract at the blockchain protocol level. We develop this design by examining and analyzing smart contracts from the infamous The DAO experiment on the Ethereum blockchain. We believe there are two contributions of this paper: it serves to inform and implore the blockchain and ontology communities to recognize and collaborate with each other; and it outlines a roadmap for engineering artifacts to bridge the gap between blockchain community focus on protocol-level blockchain interoperability and the ontology community focus on semantic-level interoperability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Henry M."},{"family":"Laskowski","given":"Marek"},{"family":"Nan","given":"Ning"}],"container-title":"arXiv:1801.02027 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,6]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"A First Step in the Co-Evolution of Blockchain and Ontologies: Towards Engineering an Ontology of Governance at the Blockchain Protocol Level","title-short":"A First Step in the Co-Evolution of Blockchain and Ontologies","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02027"},
  {"id":"KimEtAl2019","abstract":"Stellar is one of the top ten cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization. It adopts a variant of Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT), named federated Byzantine agreement (FBA), which generalizes the traditional BFT algorithm to make it more suitable for open-membership blockchains. To this end, FBA introduces a quorum slice concept, which consists of a set of nodes. In FBA, a node can complete one consensus round when it receives specific messages from nodes in a quorum slice appointed by the node. In this study, we analyze FBA, whose security is highly dependent on the structure of quorum slices, and demonstrate that it is not superior to the traditional BFT algorithm in terms of safety and liveness. Then, to analyze the security of the Stellar consensus protocol (SCP), which is a construction for FBA, we investigate the current quorum slices in Stellar. We analyze the structure of quorum slices and measure the influence of each node quantitatively using two metrics, PageRank (PR) and the newly proposed NodeRank (NR). The results show that the Stellar system is significantly centralized. Thereafter, to determine how the centralized structure can have a negative impact on the Stellar system, we study the cascading failure caused by deleting only a few nodes (i.e., validators) in Stellar. We show that all of the nodes in Stellar cannot run SCP if only two nodes fail. To make matters worse, these two nodes are run and controlled by a single organization, the Stellar foundation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Minjeong"},{"family":"Kwon","given":"Yujin"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Yongdae"}],"container-title":"arXiv:1904.13302 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,29]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Is Stellar As Secure As You Think?","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.13302"},

This work presents OmniLedger, the first scale-out distributed ledger that can preserve long-term security under permissionless operation. OmniLedger ensures strong correctness and security by using a bias-resistant public randomness protocol to choose large statistically representative shards to process trans-actions, and by introducing an efficient cross-shard commit pro-tocol to handle transactions affecting multiple shards atomically. In addition, OmniLedger optimizes performance via scalable intra-shard parallel transaction processing, ledger pruning via collectively-signed state blocks, and optional low-latency \" trust-but-verify \" validation of low-value transactions. Evaluation of our working experimental prototype shows that OmniLedger's throughput scales linearly in the number of validators available, supporting Visa-level workloads and beyond, while confirming typical transactions in under two seconds.","author":[{"family":"Kokoris-Kogias","given":"Eleftherios"},{"family":"Jovanovic","given":"Philipp"},{"family":"Gasser","given":"Linus"},{"family":"Gailly","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Syta","given":"Ewa"},{"family":"Ford","given":"Bryan"}],"container-title":"Proceedings - IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy","DOI":"10.1109/SP.2018.000-5","ISBN":"978-1-5386-4352-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"title":"OmniLedger: A Secure, Scale-Out, Decentralized Ledger via Sharding","type":"paper-conference"},

In Zyzzyva, replicas respond to a client's request without first running an expensive three-phase commit protocol to reach agreement on the order in which the request must be processed. Instead, they optimistically adopt the order proposed by the primary and respond immediately to the client. Replicas can thus become temporarily inconsistent with one another, but clients detect inconsistencies, help correct replicas converge on a single total ordering of requests, and only rely on responses that are consistent with this total order.

Existing network-based intrusion detection sensors can barely keep up with bandwidths of a few hundred Mbps.

We propose a partitioning approach to network security analysis that supports in-depth, stateful intrusion detection on high-speed links. The approach is centered around a slicing mechanism that divides the overall network trafﬁc into subsets of manageable size. The trafﬁc partitioning is done so that a single slice contains all the evidence necessary to detect a speciﬁc attack, making sensorto-sensor interactions unnecessary.

What once was rightfully ours and under our control is now spread among uncountable entities across many locations. We have built a platform that securely distributes encrypted user-sensitive data. It uses the Bitcoin blockchain to keep a trust-less audit trail for data interactions and to manage access to user data. Our platform offers advantages to both users and service providers. The user enjoys the heightened transparency, control, and security of their personal data, while the service provider becomes much less vulnerable to single point-of failures and breaches, which in turn decreases their exposure to information-security liability, thereby saving them money and protecting their brand. Our work extends an idea developed by the author and two collaborators, a peer-to- peer network that uses blockchain technology and off-blockchain storage to securely distribute sensitive data in a decentralized manner using a custom blockchain protocol. Our two main contributions are: 1. developing this platform and 2. analyzing its feasibility in real-world applications. This includes designing a protocol for data authentication that runs on an Internet scale peer-to-peer network, abstracting complex interactions with encrypted data, building a dashboard for data auditing and management, as well as building servers and sample services that use this platform for testing and evaluation.

  {"id":"LeonardosEtAl2019","abstract":"The rapid evolution of the blockchain community has brought together stakeholders from fundamentally different backgrounds: cryptographers, protocol designers, software developers, startup entrepreneurs, corporate executives and investors, academics of various disciplines, and end users. The result is a diverse ecosystem, presently exemplified by the development of a wide range of different blockchain protocols. This raises questions for policy and decision makers: How do different protocols compare? What are their trade-offs? Existing efforts to survey the area reveal a fragmented terminology, and the lack of a unified framework to make the different desirable properties of blockchain protocols explicit. In this paper, we work towards bridging this gap. We evaluate protocols within a five-dimensional design space with the following axes. Optimality: does the protocol achieve its main goals? Stability: are the incentives of its participating agents well-aligned? Efficiency: is its output maximal relative to its use of resources? Robustness: can it cope when its operational assumptions are invalid or perturbed? Persistence: can it recover from catastrophic events? Based on the relevant literature, we organize the properties of existing protocols in subcategories of increasing granularity. The result is a dynamic scheme -- termed the PREStO framework. Its scope is to aid the communication between stakeholders of different backgrounds, including managers and investors, and to identify research challenges and opportunities for blockchain protocols in a systematic way. We illustrate this via use cases and make a first step to understand the blockchain ecosystem through a more comprehensive lens.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Leonardos","given":"Stefanos"},{"family":"Reijsbergen","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Piliouras","given":"Georgios"}],"container-title":"arXiv:1906.06540 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,15]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"PREStO: A Systematic Framework for Blockchain Consensus Protocols","title-short":"PREStO","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06540"},

  {"id":"LiEtAl2016","abstract":"Recently proposed Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) systems achieve high throughput by processing requests in parallel. However, as their agreement protocols rely on a single leader and make big efforts to establish a global total order on all requests before execution, the performance and scalability of such approaches is limited. To address this problem we present SAREK, a parallel ordering framework that partitions the service state to exploit parallelism during both agreement as well as execution. SAREK utilizes request dependency which is abstracted from application-speciﬁc knowledge for the service state partitioning. Instead of having one leader at a time for the entire system, it uses one leader per partition and only establishes an order on requests accessing the same partition.

  {"id":"LiEtAl2018","abstract":"Recent research works have shown that applying parallelization to request processing in Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) can bring signiﬁcant performance improvement. Based on partitioned service state, parallelism is introduced to both agreement and execution to address performance and scalability limitations caused by the global total order of all requests. However, in case of inefﬁcient state partitioning, expensive synchronization among partitions is expected, which leads to a considerable performance loss. To improve the efﬁciency of parallel processing, we present Dynamic State Partitioning (DYPART), a framework that maps service state into multiple partitions and periodically reconﬁgures the partitions for different usage patterns. DYPART relies on the knowledge about relations between the state objects for partitioning, which is obtained by collecting request dependencies. It utilizes a highperformance graph partitioning algorithm to ensure that the resulting state partitions can achieve both workload balance and low synchronization among partitions. Our evaluation of a key-value store shows that compared to a random partitioning, DYPART can improve the performance by at least 40%.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Bijun"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Wenbo"},{"family":"Kapitza","given":"Rudiger"}],"container-title":"2018 48th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks Workshops (DSN-W)","DOI":"10.1109/DSN-W.2018.00056","event":"2018 48th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks Workshops (DSN-W)","ISBN":"978-1-5386-6553-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,6]]},"language":"en","page":"158-163","publisher":"IEEE","publisher-place":"Luxembourg","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Dynamic State Partitioning in Parallelized Byzantine Fault Tolerance","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8416241/"},
  {"id":"LiEtAl2018a","abstract":"Various protocols and architectures have been proposed to make Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) increasingly practical. However, the deployment of such systems requires dedicated client-side functionality. This is necessary as clients have to connect to multiple replicas and perform majority voting over the received replies to outvote faulty responses. Deploying custom client-side code is cumbersome, and often not an option, especially in open heterogeneous systems and for well-established protocols (e.g., HTTP and IMAP) where diverse client-side implementations co-exist. We propose Troxy, a system which relocates the BFT-specific client-side functionality to the server side, thereby making BFT transparent to legacy clients. To achieve this, Troxy relies on a trusted subsystem built upon hardware protection enabled by Intel SGX. Additionally, Troxy reduces the replication cost of BFT for read-heavy workloads by offering an actively maintained cache that supports trustworthy read operations while preserving the consistency guarantees offered by the underlying BFT protocol. A prototype of Troxy has been built and evaluated, and results indicate that using Troxy (1) leads to at most 43% performance loss with small ordered messages in a local network environment, while (2) improves throughput by 130% with read-heavy workloads in a simulated wide-area network.","author":[{"family":"Li","given":"B."},{"family":"Weichbrodt","given":"N."},{"family":"Behl","given":"J."},{"family":"Aublin","given":"P."},{"family":"Distler","given":"T."},{"family":"Kapitza","given":"R."}],"container-title":"2018 48th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN)","DOI":"10.1109/DSN.2018.00019","event":"2018 48th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN)","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,6]]},"page":"59-70","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Troxy: Transparent Access to Byzantine Fault-Tolerant Systems","title-short":"Troxy","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"LiuEtAl2015","abstract":"Despite years of intensive research, Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) systems have not yet been adopted in practice. This is due to additional cost of BFT in terms of resources, protocol complexity and performance, compared with crash fault-tolerance (CFT). This overhead of BFT comes from the assumption of a powerful adversary that can fully control not only the Byzantine faulty machines, but at the same time also the message delivery schedule across the entire network, effectively inducing communication asynchrony and partitioning otherwise correct machines at will. To many practitioners, however, such strong attacks appear irrelevant. In this paper, we introduce cross fault tolerance or XFT, a novel approach to building reliable and secure distributed systems and apply it to the classical state-machine replication (SMR) problem. In short, an XFT SMR protocol provides the reliability guarantees of widely used asynchronous CFT SMR protocols such as Paxos and Raft, but also tolerates Byzantine faults in combination with network asynchrony, as long as a majority of replicas are correct and communicate synchronously. This allows the development of XFT systems at the price of CFT (already paid for in practice), yet with strictly stronger resilience than CFT — sometimes even stronger than BFT itself. As a showcase for XFT, we present XPaxos, the first XFT SMR protocol, and deploy it in a geo-replicated setting. Although it offers much stronger resilience than CFT SMR at no extra resource cost, the performance of XPaxos matches that of the state-of-the-art CFT protocols.","author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Shengyun"},{"family":"Viotti","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"Cachin","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Quéma","given":"Vivien"},{"family":"Vukolić","given":"Marko"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"page":"1–41","title":"XFT: Practical Fault Tolerance Beyond Crashes","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05831"},

In particular, the blockchain community has been looking for ways to effectively integrate traditional Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) protocols into a blockchain consensus layer allowing various financial institutions to securely agree on the order of transactions. However, existing BFT protocols can only scale to tens of nodes due to their O(n 2) message complexity. In this paper, we propose FastBFT, a fast and scalable BFT protocol. At the heart of FastBFT is a novel message aggregation technique that combines hardware-based trusted execution environments (TEEs) with lightweight secret sharing. Combining this technique with several other optimizations (i.e., optimistic execution, tree topology and failure detection), FastBFT achieves low latency and high throughput even for large scale networks. Via systematic analysis and experiments, we demonstrate that FastBFT has better scalability and performance than previous BFT protocols.","author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Jian"},{"family":"Li","given":"Wenting"},{"family":"Karame","given":"Ghassan O"},{"family":"Asokan","given":"N"}],"DOI":"10.1109/TC.2018.2860009","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"title":"Scalable Byzantine Consensus via Hardware-assisted Secret Sharing","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.04997.pdf"},
  {"id":"LopezEtAl2019","abstract":"The old mantra of decentralizing the Internet is coming again with fanfare, this time around the blockchain technology hype. We have already seen a technology supposed to change the nature of the Internet: peer-to-peer. The reality is that peer-to-peer naming systems failed, peer-to-peer social networks failed, and yes, peer-to-peer storage failed as well. In this paper, we will review the research on distributed systems in the last few years to identify the limits of open peer-to-peer networks. We will address issues like system complexity, security and frailty, instability and performance. We will show how many of the aforementioned problems also apply to the recent breed of permissionless blockchain networks. The applicability of such systems to mature industrial applications is undermined by the same properties that make them so interesting for a libertarian audience: namely, their openness, their pseudo-anonymity and their unregulated cryptocurrencies. As such, we argue that permissionless blockchain networks are unsuitable to be the substrate for a decentralized Internet. Yet, there is still hope for more decentralization, albeit in a form somewhat limited with respect to the libertarian view of decentralized Internet: in cooperation rather than in competition with the superpowerful datacenters that dominate the world today. This is derived from the recent surge in interest in byzantine fault tolerance and permissioned blockchains, which opens the door to a world where use of trusted third parties is not the only way to arbitrate an ensemble of entities. The ability of establish trust through permissioned blockchains enables to move the control from the datacenters to the edge, truly realizing the promises of edge-centric computing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Lopez","given":"Pedro Garcia"},{"family":"Montresor","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Datta","given":"Anwitaman"}],"container-title":"arXiv:1904.13093 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,30]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Please, do not decentralize the Internet with (permissionless) blockchains!","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.13093"},

  {"id":"LuuEtAl2016","abstract":"Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and 250 similar alt-coins, embody at their core a blockchain protocol-a mechanism for a distributed network of computational nodes to periodically agree on a set of new transactions. Designing a secure blockchain protocol relies on an open challenge in security, that of designing a highly-scalable agreement protocol open to manipulation by byzantine or arbitrarily malicious nodes. Bitcoin's blockchain agreement protocol exhibits security, but does not scale: it processes 3-7 transactions per second at present, irrespective of the available computation capacity at hand. In this paper, we propose a new distributed agreement protocol for permission-less blockchains called ELASTICO. ELASTICO scales transaction rates almost linearly with available computation for mining: the more the computation power in the network, the higher the number of transaction blocks selected per unit time. ELASTICO is efficient in its network messages and tolerates byzan-tine adversaries of up to one-fourth of the total computational power. Technically, ELASTICO uniformly partitions or parallelizes the mining network (securely) into smaller committees, each of which processes a disjoint set of transactions (or \"shards\"). While sharding is common in non-byzantine settings, ELASTICO is the first candidate for a secure sharding protocol with presence of byzantine adversaries. Our scalability experiments on Amazon EC2 with up to 1, 600 nodes confirm ELASTICO's theoretical scaling properties.","author":[{"family":"Luu","given":"Loi"},{"family":"Narayanan","given":"Viswesh"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Chaodong"},{"family":"Baweja","given":"Kunal"},{"family":"Gilbert","given":"Seth"},{"family":"Saxena","given":"Prateek"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security - CCS'16","DOI":"10.1145/2976749.2978389","ISBN":"978-1-4503-4139-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"title":"A Secure Sharding Protocol For Open Blockchains","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/ loiluu/papers/elastico.pdf"},

The Internet of Things is therefore creating a unique set of risk and problems that will affect most households. From breaches in confidentiality, which could allow users to be snooped on, through to failures in integrity, which could lead to consumer data being compromised; devices are presenting many security challenges to which consumers are ill equipped to protect themselves from. Moreover, when this is coupled with the heterogeneous nature of the industry, and the interoperable and scalability problems it becomes apparent that the Internet of Things has created an increased attack surface from which security vulnerabilities may be easily exploited. However, it has been conjectured that blockchain may provide a solution to the Internet of Things security and scalability problems. Because of blockchain's immutability, integrity and scalability, it is possible that its architecture could be used for the storage and transfer of Internet of Things data.

  {"id":"MalkhiEtAl2019","abstract":"This paper introduces Flexible BFT, a new approach for BFT consensus solution design revolving around two pillars, stronger resilience and diversity. The first pillar, stronger resilience, involves a new fault model called alive-but-corrupt faults. Alive-but-corrupt replicas may arbitrarily deviate from the protocol in an attempt to break safety of the protocol. However, if they cannot break safety, they will not try to prevent liveness of the protocol. Combining alive-but-corrupt faults into the model, Flexible BFT is resilient to higher corruption levels than possible in a pure Byzantine fault model. The second pillar, diversity, designs consensus solutions whose protocol transcript is used to draw different commit decisions under diverse beliefs. With this separation, the same Flexible BFT solution supports synchronous and asynchronous beliefs, as well as varying resilience threshold combinations of Byzantine and alive-but-corrupt faults. At a technical level, Flexible BFT achieves the above results using two new ideas. First, it introduces a synchronous BFT protocol in which only the commit step requires to know the network delay bound and thus replicas execute the protocol without any synchrony assumption. Second, it introduces a notion called Flexible Byzantine Quorums by dissecting the roles of different quorums in existing consensus protocols.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Malkhi","given":"Dahlia"},{"family":"Nayak","given":"Kartik"},{"family":"Ren","given":"Ling"}],"container-title":"arXiv:1904.10067 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,30]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Flexible Byzantine Fault Tolerance","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10067"},

This paper introduces Parallel State-Machine Replication (P-SMR), a new approach to parallelism in state-machine replication. P-SMR scales better than previous proposals since no component plays a centralizing role in the execution of independent commands-those that can be executed concurrently, as defined by the service.

  {"id":"Marcoullis2018","abstract":"State machine replication (SMR) in distributed computing is fundamental when employing redundancy of storage to facilitate fault-tolerance. It aims at maintaining the consistency of the state of several copies of a -possibly dynamic- distributed object, thus, providing increased availability. At the same time, it strives to reduce the impact on the system’s performance. Research on cloud systems has significantly benefited from accumulated knowledge on SMR to quickly progress towards making cloud services efficient and reliable. Two established paradigms providing SMR are consensus and virtual synchrony (VS). Consensus-based SMR algorithms are widely studied and used, and well understood. Recently, Byzantine-tolerant SMR was proposed as an alternative to the Proof-of-Work (PoW) paradigm of block ordering in blockchains. This is because it is suggested to overcome the poor performance scalability of PoW and avoid the high energy consumptions. On the other hand, systems that provide the VS property are today directed towards high-speed cloud services.\nSystems implementing SMR provide guarantees based on assumptions like bounded churn rates, bounded replica failures, failure-free probabilistic error de- tection mechanisms, or that system variables are started in a consistent state. If these are, even temporarily, violated due to the occurrence of transient faults, then this may corrupt the state of a single or multiple replicas, including its program coun- ters. Subsequently, this leads the system to an arbitrary state, causing it to become possibly unavailable, unless there is human intervention. Self-stabilizing systems enhance existing fault tolerant systems to allow them to automatically recover from transient failures. In this way, and combined with other fault-tolerance techniques, self-stabilization provides a comprehensive and robust fault-resilience and recovery strategy.\nThis thesis proposes self-stabilizing algorithmic solutions with proven guarantees to several SMR-related problems. In this framework, we initially present the first practically-self-stabilizing VS-based SMR for a static crash-prone replica set. We then introduce dynamicity in the membership of the replica set, and provide a modular self-stabilizing reconfiguration scheme that can lead to self-stabilizing reconfigurable SMR (based on either VS or consensus). We then address the more challenging failure model of Byzantine faults, and propose a malicious-tolerant self-stabilizing SMR algorithm based on implementable failure detectors. The thesis also bears several by-products such as a self-stabilizing counter that can be incremented in distributed fashion, and novel design and proof techniques. Considered together, the three results cover a significant gap towards achieving self-stabilizing versions of SMR-based blockchain frameworks or of reconfigurable Byzantine-tolerant SMRs.","author":[{"family":"Marcoullis","given":"Ioannis"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","publisher":"University of Cyprus","source":"Zotero","title":"Self-Stabilizing State Machine Replication in Static and Reconfigurable Asynchronous Message-Passing Systems","type":"thesis","URL":"http://www.cs.ucy.ac.cy/~imarco01/thesis_phd.pdf"},

We review the privacy and security properties offered by the scheme we have constructed, and compare its efficiency with other commonly suggested approaches to privacy on the blockchain.","author":[{"family":"Mercer","given":"Rebekah"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"title":"Privacy on the Blockchain: Unique Ring Signatures","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01188"},

This theorem was stated and proved assuming that ‘consistency’ refers to atomic consistency. However, multiple consistency models exist and atomic consistency is located at the strongest edge of that spectrum. Many distributed services deployed in cloud platforms should be highly available and scalable. Network partitions may arise in those deployments and should be tolerated. One way of dealing with CAP constraints consists in relaxing consistency. Therefore, it is interesting to explore the set of consistency models not supported in an available and partition-tolerant service (CAP-constrained models). Other weaker consistency models could be maintained when scalable services are deployed in partitionable systems (CAP-free models). Three contributions arise: (i) multiple other CAP-constrained models are identified, (ii) a borderline between CAP-constrained and CAP-free models is set and (iii) a hierarchy of consistency models depending on their strength and convergence is built.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Muñoz-Escoí","given":"Francesc D"},{"family":"Juan-Marín","given":"Rubén","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"García-Escrivá","given":"José-Ramón"},{"family":"González de Mendívil","given":"J R"},{"family":"Bernabéu-Aubán","given":"José M"}],"container-title":"The Computer Journal","container-title-short":"The Computer Journal","DOI":"10.1093/comjnl/bxy142","ISSN":"0010-4620","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,16]]},"page":"943-960","title":"CAP Theorem: Revision of Its Related Consistency Models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/bxy142","volume":"62"},

In more detail, we produce two new randomized algorithms that solve this problem in the abstract MAC layer model, which captures the basic interface and communication guarantees provided by most wireless MAC layers. Our algorithms work for any number of failures, require no advance knowledge of the network participants or network size, and guarantee termination with high probability after a number of broadcasts that are polynomial in the network size. Our first algorithm satisfies the standard agreement property, while our second trades a faster termination guarantee in exchange for a looser agreement property in which most nodes agree on the same value. These are the first known fault-tolerant consensus algorithms for this model. In addition to our main upper bound results, we explore the gap between the abstract MAC layer and the standard asynchronous message passing model by proving fault-tolerant consensus is impossible in the latter in the absence of information regarding the network participants, even if we assume no faults, allow randomized solutions, and provide the algorithm a constant-factor approximation of the network size.","author":[{"family":"Newport","given":"Calvin"},{"family":"Robinson","given":"Peter"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,10]]},"title":"Fault-Tolerant Consensus with an Abstract MAC Layer","type":"report","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02848"},
  {"id":"NguyenEtAl2019","abstract":"Consistency properties provided by most key-value stores can be classified into sequential consistency and eventual consistency. The former is easier to program with but suffers from lower performance whereas the latter suffers from potential anomalies while providing higher performance. We focus on the problem of what a designer should do if he/she has an algorithm that works correctly with sequential consistency but is faced with an underlying key-value store that provides a weaker consistency. We propose a detect-rollback based approach: The designer identifies a correctness predicate, say $P$, and continues to run the protocol, as our system monitors $P$. If $P$ is violated (because of weaker consistency), the system rolls back and resumes the computation at a state where $P$ holds. We evaluate this approach with graph-based applications running on the Voldemort key-value store. Our experiments with deployment on Amazon AWS EC2 instances shows that using eventual consistency with monitoring can provide a $50\\%$ -- $80\\%$ increase in throughput when compared with sequential consistency. We also observe that the overhead of the monitoring itself was low (typically less than $4\\%$) and the latency of detecting violations was small. In particular, in a scenario designed to intentionally cause a large number of violations, more than $99.9\\%$ of violations were detected in less than 50 milliseconds in regional networks, and in less than 3 seconds in global networks. We find that for some applications, frequent rollback can cause the program using eventual consistency to effectively \\textit{stall}. We propose alternate mechanisms for dealing with re-occurring rollbacks. Overall, for applications considered in this paper, we find that even with rollback, eventual consistency provides better performance than using sequential consistency.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Duong"},{"family":"Charapko","given":"Aleksey"},{"family":"Kulkarni","given":"Sandeep S."},{"family":"Demirbas","given":"Murat"}],"container-title":"arXiv:1909.01980 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,3]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Using Weaker Consistency Models with Monitoring and Recovery for Improving Performance of Key-Value Stores","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01980"},

Blockchain has solved the problem of changing the original low-trust centralized ledger held by a single third-party, to a high-trust decentralized form held by different entities, or in other words, verifying nodes. The key contribution of the work of Blockchain is the consensus algorithm, which decides how agreement is made to append a new block between all nodes in the verifying network. Blockchain algorithms can be categorized into two main groups. The first group is proof-based consensus, which requires the nodes joining the verifying network to show that they are more qualified than the others to do the appending work. The second group is voting-based consensus, which requires nodes in the network to exchange their results of verifying a new block or transaction, before making the final decision.

  {"id":"PassShi2016a","abstract":"Consensus, or state machine replication is a foundational building block of distributed systems and modern cryptography. Consensus in the classical, permissioned setting has been extensively studied in the 30 years of distributed systems literature. Recent developments in Bitcoin and other decentralized cryptocurrencies popularized a new form of consensus in a “permissionless” setting, where anyone can join and leave dynamically, and there is no a-priori knowledge of the consensus nodes. Despite this exciting breakthrough, today’s permissionless consensus protocols, often referred to as “blockchains”, are known to have terrible performance, which has resulted in heated, and at times acrimonious debates in the community. First, we show that unfortunately a performance loss is inherent for any protocol that secures against at least 1/3 corruptions in hashpower. Specifically, we formally define a new performance measure called responsiveness, and show that any responsive permissionless consensus protocol cannot tolerate 1/3 or more corruptions in hashpower. Next, we show a tightly matching uppper bound. Specifically, we propose a new permissionless consensus protocol called hybrid consensus, that is responsive and secures against up to 1/3 corruptions in hashpower. Hybrid consensus's idea is to bootstrap fast permissionless consensus by combining an inefficient blockchain protocol with a fast permissioned consensus protocol. Hybrid consensus uses the blockchain not to agree on transactions, but to agree on rotating committees which in turn execute permissioned consensus protocols to agree on transactions. While the high-level idea is intuitive, formally instantiating and reasoning about the protocol exposed a multitude of non-trivial technical subtleties and challenges.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Pass","given":"Rafael"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Elaine"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"number":"917","source":"ePrint IACR","title":"Hybrid Consensus: Efficient Consensus in the Permissionless Model","title-short":"Hybrid Consensus","type":"report","URL":"https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/917"},

  {"id":"PeaseEtAl1980","abstract":"The problem addressed here concerns a set of isolated processors, some unknown subset of which may be faulty, that communicate only by means of two-party messages. Each nonfaulty processor has a private value of information that must be communicated to each other nonfaulty processor. Nonfaulty processors always communicate honestly, whereas faulty processors may lie. The problem is to devise an algorithm in which processors communicate their own values and relay values received from others that allows each nonfaulty processor to infer a value for each other processor. The value inferred for a nonfaulty processor must be that processor's private value, and the value inferred for a faulty one must be consistent with the corresponding value inferred by each other nonfaulty processor.$\\backslash$nIt is shown that the problem is solvable for, and only for, n ≥ 3m + 1, where m is the number of faulty processors and n is the total number.

However, the majority of the previous studies have focused on the technical aspects, and overlooked blockchain investigation from a managerial perspective. In this paper, based on platform-ecosystem, transaction cost economics, and open-source literature, we contrast and compare blockchain-based platforms and centralized platforms; in other words, decentralized versus centralized governance modes. We base our conceptual analysis on three dimensions—transaction cost, cost of technology, and community involvement—, exploring the conditions under which blockchain-based platforms are more advantageous than centralized platforms. We first compare gains from lower opportunism and uncertainty costs thanks to protocols and smart contracts in blockchain technology versus the costs of higher coordination and complexity of (re)writing those contracts. Second, we compare the gains from immutability and transparency in blockchain-based platforms versus the technological costs of verification and storage of a distributed ledger. Finally, we compare intrinsic and extrinsic motivations of the communities around centralized and blockchain-based platforms in the short and medium term.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Pereira","given":"Joana"},{"family":"Tavalaei","given":"M.

  {"id":"Robinson2019","abstract":"A Coordination Blockchain is a blockchain with the task of coordinating activities of multiple private blockchains. This paper discusses the pros and cons of using Ethereum MainNet, the public Ethereum blockchain, as a Coordination Blockchain. The requirements Ethereum MainNet needs to fulfil to perform this role are discussed within the context of Ethereum Private Sidechains, a private blockchain technology which allows many blockchains to be operated in parallel, and allows atomic crosschain transactions to execute across blockchains. Ethereum MainNet is a permissionless network which aims to offer strong authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation properties, that incentivises good behaviour using crypto economics. This paper demonstrates that Ethereum MainNet does deliver these properties. It then provides a comprehensive review of the features of Ethereum Private Sidechains, with a focus on the potential usage of Coordination Blockchains for these features. Finally, the merits of using Ethereum MainNet as a Coordination Blockchain are assessed. For Ethereum Private Sidechains, we found that Ethereum MainNet is best suited to storing long term static data that needs to be widely available, such as the Ethereum Registration Authority information. However, due to Ethereum MainNet's probabilistic finality, it is not well suited to information that needs to be available and acted upon immediately, such as the Sidechain Public Keys and Atomic Crosschain Transaction state information that need to be accessible prior to the first atomic crosschain transaction being issued on a sidechain. Although this paper examined the use of Ethereum MainNet as a Coordination Blockchain within reference to Ethereum Private Sidechains, the discussions and observations of the typical tasks a Coordination blockchain may be expected to perform are applicable more widely to any multi-blockchain system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Robinson","given":"Peter"}],"container-title":"arXiv:1906.04421 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,11]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"The merits of using Ethereum MainNet as a Coordination Blockchain for Ethereum Private Sidechains","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04421"},

The research applies the Actor-Network Theory (ANT) framework to the policy dynamics around the first IXP formed in Mexico, contributing to unveil the materiality of internet infrastructure and the imaginary that surrounds it. Following Michel Callon (1984)’s three principles: agnosticism – to be impartial with the parts of a controversy; symmetry – to analyze different perspectives with the same lens; and free association – to break the divide between society and technological artifacts, the analysis shows how technical and political aspects are completely interlaced in the design and implementation of an IXP, here defined as a network of relationships. Organizations—characterized by their design and governance—along with individuals, documents, laws, and technology artifacts, are significant actors in the scenario where social, political and economic goals are delegated to the IXP’s technical functions. The lack of convergence among these actors, however, prevents the project from succeeding in the first years of deployment as its implementers expected, while regulatory documents work as the supporters of a dynamic equilibrium to keep the project ongoing.","author":[{"family":"Rosa","given":"Fernanda R"}],"language":"en","page":"19","source":"Zotero","title":"Internet Node as a Network of Relationships:","type":"article-journal"},

Two confronting standpoints dominate the emergent debate around blockchain-based governance: discourses characterised by the presence of techno-determinist and market-driven values, which tend to ignore the complexity of social organisation; and critical accounts of such discourses which, whilst contributing to identifying limitations, consider the role of traditional centralised institutions as inherently necessary to enable democratic forms of governance. Therefore the question arises, can we build perspectives of blockchain-based governance that go beyond markets and states? In this article we draw on the Nobel laureate economist Elinor Ostrom's principles for self-governance of communities to explore the transformative potential of blockchain. We approach blockchain through the identification and conceptualisation of affordances that this technology may provide to communities. For each affordance, we carry out a detailed analysis situating each in the context of Ostrom's principles, considering both the potentials of algorithmic governance and the importance of incorporating communities' social practices. The relationships found between these affordances and Ostrom's principles allow us to provide a perspective focussed on blockchain-based commons governance. By carrying out this analysis, we aim to expand the debate from one dominated by a culture of competition to one that promotes a culture of cooperation.","author":[{"family":"Rozas","given":"David"},{"family":"Tenorio-Fornés","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Díaz-Molina","given":"Silvia"},{"family":"Hassan","given":"Samer"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,30]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"When Ostrom Meets Blockchain: Exploring the Potentials of Blockchain for Commons Governance","title-short":"When Ostrom Meets Blockchain","type":"book"},

Pure cryptographic solutions based on fully homomorphic and verifiable encryption, recently proposed, are promising but suffer from very high latency. Other proposals perform the whole computation on tamper-proof hardware and usually suffer from the the same problem. Trusted computing (TC) is another promising approach that uses trusted software and hardware components on computing platforms to provide useful mechanisms such as attestation allowing the data owner to verify the integrity of the cloud and its computation. However, on the one hand these solutions require trust in hardware (CPU, trusted computing modules) that are under the physical control of the cloud provider, and on the other hand they still have to face the challenge of run-time attestation. In this paper we focus on applications where the latency of the computation should be minimized, i.e., the time from submitting the query until receiving the outcome of the computation should be as small as possible. To achieve this we show how to combine a trusted hardware token (e.g., a cryptographic coprocessor or provided by the customer) with Secure Function Evaluation (SFE) to compute arbitrary functions on secret (encrypted) data where the computation leaks no information and is verifiable. The token is used in the setup phase only whereas in the time-critical online phase the cloud computes the encrypted function on encrypted data using symmetric encryption primitives only and without any interaction with other entities.","author":[{"family":"Sadeghi","given":"Ahmad-Reza"},{"family":"Schneider","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Winandy","given":"Marcel"}],"ISSN":"3-642-13868-3, 978-3-642-13868-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,1,1]]},"page":"417-429","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Token-based cloud computing: secure outsourcing of data and arbitrary computations with lower latency","title-short":"Token-based cloud computing","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"Shi2018","abstract":"Most classical consensus protocols rely on a leader to coordinate nodes’ voting efforts. One novel idea that stems from blockchain-style consensus is to rely, instead, on a “longest-chain” idea for such coordination. Such a longest-chain idea was initially considered in randomized protocols, where in each round, a node has some probability of being elected a leader who can propose the next block. Recently, well-known systems have started implementing the deterministic counterpart of such longest-chain protocols — the deterministic counterpart is especially attractive since it is even simpler to implement than their randomized cousins. A notable instantiation is the Aura protocol which is shipped with Parity’s open-source Ethereum implementation. Interestingly, mathematical analyses of deterministic, longest-chain protocols are lacking even though there exist several analyses of randomized versions. In this paper, we provide the first formal analysis of deterministic, longest-chain-style consensus. We show that a variant of the Aura protocol can defend against a Byzantine adversary that controls fewer than 1/3 fraction of the nodes, and this resilience parameter is tight by some technical interpretation. Based on insights gained through our mathematical treatment, we point out that Aura’s concrete instantiation actually fails to achieve the resiliene level they claim. Finally, while our tight proof for the longest-chain protocol is rather involved and non-trivial; we show that a variant of the “longest-chain” idea which we call “largest-set” enables a textbook construction that admits a simple proof (albeit with slower confirmation).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Shi","given":"Elaine"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"number":"1079","source":"ePrint IACR","title":"Analysis of Deterministic Longest-Chain Protocols","type":"report","URL":"http://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1079"},

To reduce cost, we incorporate on-demand instantiation, which activates a subset of replicas first and activates backup ones when active ones fail. To solve its key limitation—the system can be halted for long when activating a backup replica, we apply lazy recovery, al- lowing the system to proceed while recovering backup nodes in the background. The key contribution of this paper is to identify that, when agreement nodes and exe- cution nodes are logically separated, they each presents a unique property that enables lazy recovery. We have ap- plied this idea to Paxos and built ThriftyPaxos, which, as shown in the evaluation, can achieve higher throughput and similar availability comparing to standard Paxos, de- spite the fact that ThriftyPaxos activates fewer replicas.","author":[{"family":"Shi","given":"Rong"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yang"}],"container-title":"2016 USENIX Annual Technical Conference (USENIX ATC '16)","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"page":"265–279","title":"Cheap and Available State Machine Replication","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/atc16/atc16_paper-shi.pdf"},

  {"id":"StoufferEtAl2004","abstract":"Intrusion Tolerance www.computer.org/security/ ■ ieee seCurity & PrivaCy 19 quently, this architecture supports solutions both with outsider threats-protecting a facility from the Inter-net-and insider threats-protecting a highly critical host from other hosts in the same physical facility by locating them in different LANs. A Crutial information switch protects each LAN (see Figure 1). A CIS provides two basic services: The protection service ensures that the incoming and outgoing traffic from the LAN satisfies the security policy of the organization managing the LAN. The communication service supports secure communication between the CIS and, ultimately, between LANs. It provides secure channels and multicast between CISs. In this article, we focus on the protection service. A CIS is a distributed protection device with the following main characteristics: It resembles a distributed firewall 3 because organizations • • • can deploy it not only at the network border but also inside the network to protect critical equipment. It uses a rich access-control model that considers the involvement of different organizations and lets the access control rules depend on context information. 4 It's intrusion-tolerant 5-that is, it operates correctly even if an attacker intrudes in some of its components. Its objective is to withstand a high degree of hostility from the environment. Researchers have proposed other intrusion-tolerant services (a brief survey is available elsewhere 6); however , the CIS design differs from those services in two essential ways. First, a firewall-like component has to be transparent to the protocols that pass through it, so it cannot modify these protocols to obtain intrusion tolerance. Second, internal CIS intrusion-tolerance mechanisms must be transparent to recipient nodes, because such nodes can't protect themselves from malicious messages forwarded by faulty CIS components not satisfying the security policy. • • C ritical infrastructure protection is harder to address than information and communication technology (ICT) protection because of these infrastructures' interconnection complexity, which can lead to various kinds of problems. Consider the power grid, in which geographically dispersed production sites distribute power through different voltage level stations (from higher to lower voltage) until energy eventually flows into our houses. Both the production and distribution sites are typically controlled by supervisory control and data-acquisition (SCada) systems, which are remotely connected to supervision centers and to the corporate networks (intranets) of the companies managing the infrastructures. The intranets are linked to the Internet to facilitate, for example, communication with power regulators and end clients. These links create a path for external attackers. Operators access SCada systems remotely for maintenance operations, and sometimes equipment suppliers keep links to the systems through modems. From the viewpoint of keeping the system working, this is all a good idea, but from a security perspective, this looks like a recipe for serious problems. 1 This conclusion is far from speculation: a few years ago, an Internet worm entered a nuclear plant's supervision systems through a supplier's modem, which almost caused a disaster. 2 On a more positive side, critical infrastructure companies and governments have been showing a high level of concern about this state of affairs, and have been pushing several security measures. However, a careful reading of the legion of guidelines being produced (for example, US National Institute of Standards and Technology specification 800-82 3) shows a common trend that we can summarize in a couple of ideas: critical infrastructure protection is a network security problem that should be handled using secure communication protocols and perimeter protection through firewalls. These mechanisms are a first level of protection with undeniable utility and importance. However, they put critical infrastructure protection at the level of ICT security, which is inadequate because of these infrastructures' criticality and societal relevance. Moreover, firewalls are known to be vulnerable to intrusions and denial-of-service attacks. The US National Vulnerability database reported 9 vulnerabilities that might lead to intrusions in commercial firewalls in 2005, 15 in 2006, and again 15 in 2007. The total number of vulnerabilities reported for these three years is 79. We clearly need more than classical prevention security mechanisms such as firewalls. However, when building new solutions, developers must recognize that critical infrastructures feature numerous legacy subsystems and noncomputational components, such as controllers , sensors, and actuators, which can't be modified for operational reasons or others, for several years to come. In addition, a company's main concern is keeping its critical infrastructure working at the expected level of service. Security mechanisms that stand in the way of operation are unacceptable.","author":[{"family":"Stouffer","given":"K"},{"family":"Falco","given":"J"},{"family":"Kent","given":"K"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2004]]},"page":"20–23","title":"Security of critical control systems sparks concern","type":"report","URL":"www.computer.org/security/"},

  {"id":"SytaEtAl2016","abstract":"Bias-resistant public randomness is a critical component in many (distributed) protocols. Existing solutions do not scale to hundreds or thousands of participants, as is needed in many decentralized systems. We propose two large-scale distributed protocols, RandHound and RandHerd, which provide publicly-verifiable, unpredictable, and unbiasable randomness against Byzantine adversaries. RandHound relies on an untrusted client to divide a set of randomness servers into groups for scalability, and it depends on the pigeonhole principle to ensure output integrity, even for non-random, adversarial group choices. RandHerd implements an efficient, decentralized randomness beacon. RandHerd is structurally similar to a BFT protocol, but uses RandHound in a one-time setup to arrange participants into verifiably unbiased random secret-sharing groups, which then repeatedly produce random output at predefined intervals. Our prototype demonstrates that RandHound and RandHerd achieve good performance across hundreds of participants while retaining a low failure probability by properly selecting protocol parameters, such as a group size and secret-sharing threshold. For example, when sharding 512 nodes into groups of 32, our experiments show that RandHound can produce fresh random output after 240 seconds. RandHerd, after a setup phase of 260 seconds, is able to generate fresh random output in intervals of approximately 6 seconds. For this configuration, both protocols operate at a failure probability of at most 0.08% against a Byzantine adversary.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Syta","given":"Ewa"},{"family":"Jovanovic","given":"Philipp"},{"family":"Kogias","given":"Eleftherios Kokoris"},{"family":"Gailly","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Gasser","given":"Linus"},{"family":"Khoffi","given":"Ismail"},{"family":"Fischer","given":"Michael J."},{"family":"Ford","given":"Bryan"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"number":"1067","source":"ePrint IACR","title":"Scalable Bias-Resistant Distributed Randomness","type":"report","URL":"http://eprint.iacr.org/2016/1067"},

  {"id":"Tange2018","abstract":"In recent years, Byzantine consensus algorithms have seen a surge in popularitywith the rise of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. A major problem that hampersadoption of existing consensus algorithms in blockchain scenarios is their scalability. There has been much research in the past years aiming to optimize thesealgorithms and increase their efficiency. For example, recent work has shown that voting rounds present in many classical algorithms can be made drastically more efficient by the use of message aggregation techniques. \n \nAnother trend is towards the usage of trusted hardware to increase performance and lower resource requirementsof these algorithms. Trusted hardware enables algorithms to reduce the lower bound on the number of replicas from $3f+1$ to $2f+1$, where $f$ is the number of tolerated faults. Currently, all existing Byzantine consensus algorithms either use no trusted hardware at all, or assume that all replicas have access to the same trusted hardware. This leaves a gap in the design space, neglecting scenarios where only some machines have access to trusted hardware.  \n \nIn this work, we investigate the possibilities where only a subset of all replicas has access to trusted hardware. We introduce the SACBFT framework, consisting of two transformations that can be applied to existing Byzantine consensus protocols, increasing their efficiency by allowing them to make use of trusted hardware that exists in the system. \n \nWe apply the framework to PBFT and RePBFT to produce SACPBFT and SACRePBFT respectively, and show how to apply the framework to other protocols. We also evaluate a proof-of-concept implementation of SACPBFT, showing that it can dramatically reduce network usage and increase performance even when only a single replica has access to trusted hardware.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Tange","given":"Koen"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,20]]},"language":"en","source":"aaltodoc.aalto.fi","title":"High Speed Consensus with Trusted Execution Environments","type":"thesis","URL":"https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi:443/handle/123456789/33692"},

Untimely (stale) results may have severe consequences that could render the control system’s behaviour hazardous to the physical world. To ensure predictability and timeliness, developers follow a rigorous process, which essentially ensures real-time properties a priori, in all but the most unlikely combinations of circumstances. However, we have seen the complexity of both real-time applications, and the environments they run on, increase. If this is matched with the also increasing sophistication of attacks mounted to RTES systems, the case for ensuring both safety and security through aprioristic predictability loses traction, and presents an opportunity, which we take in this paper, for discussing current practices of critical realtime system design. To this end, with a slant on low-level task scheduling, we ﬁrst investigate the challenges and opportunities for anticipating successful attacks on real-time systems. Then, we propose ways for adapting traditional fault- and intrusiontolerant mechanisms to tolerate such hazards. We found that tasks which typically execute as analyzed under accidental faults, may exhibit fundamentally different behavior when compromised by malicious attacks, even with interference enforcement in place.","author":[{"family":"Voelp","given":"Marcus"},{"family":"Esteves-Verissimo","given":"Paulo"}],"container-title":"2nd Workshop on the Security and Dependability of Critical Embedded Real-Time Systems (CERTS)","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","page":"8","publisher-place":"Paris, France","source":"Zotero","title":"Facing the Safety-Security Gap in RTES: the Challenge of Timeliness","type":"paper-conference"},

Bitcoin uses this technology to provide a provenance-driven verifiable ledger that is based on consensus. Nevertheless, the use of blockchain as a transaction service in non-cryptocurrency applications, for example, business networks, is at a very nascent stage. While the blockchain supports transactional provenance, the data management community and other scientific and industrial communities are assessing how blockchain can be used to enable certain key capabilities for business applications. We have reviewed a number of proof of concepts and early adoptions of blockchain solutions that we have been involved spanning diverse use cases to draw common data life cycle, persis- tence as well as analytics patterns used in real-world applications with the ultimate aim to identify new frontier of exciting re- search in blockchain data management and analytics. In this paper, we discuss several open topics that researchers could in- crease focus on: (1) leverage existing capabilities of mature data and information systems, (2) enhance data security and privacy assurances, (3) enable analytics services on blockchain as well as across off-chain data, and (4) make blockchain-based systems active-oriented and intelligent.","author":[{"family":"Vo","given":"Hoang Tam"},{"family":"Kundu","given":"Ashish"},{"family":"Mohania","given":"Mukesh"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Extending Database Technology (EDBT)","DOI":"10.5441/002/edbt.2018.43","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"page":"445–448","title":"Research Directions in Blockchain Data Management and Analytics","type":"article-journal","volume":"21"},

In particular, we show that the claimed (proved) fork-free property is not true and several assumptions in ALGORAND are not realistic in practice. The ALGORAND wiki page https://golden.com/wiki/Algorand claims that “the probability of a fork in the protocol is estimated at 1/1,000,000,000 and therefore blocks can be considered ﬁnal upon validation”. However, our ﬁrst attack in this paper shows that a malicious adversary who controls less than 1/3 of the users (or money units) could fork the ALGORAND chain very easily. Our second attack shows that a malicious adversary could use a bribery attack to fork the ALGORAND chain very easily also. Furthermore, we show that the celebrated Byzantine Agreement component in ALGORAND is not necessary. The Byzantine Agreement is the most expensive part and one of the most innovative parts in the ALGORAND protocol. It is used to avoid forks in ALGORAND. We show that a simple majority vote could be used to achieve the same property that Byzantine Agreement achieves in ALGORAND under the same network assumption.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Yongge"}],"container-title":"arXiv:1905.04463 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,11]]},"language":"en","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Another Look at ALGORAND","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04463"},

  {"id":"WangEtAl2019","abstract":"The past decade has witnessed the rapid evolution in blockchain technologies, which has attracted tremendous interests from both the research communities and industries. The blockchain network was originated from the Internet ﬁnancial sector as a decentralized, immutable ledger system for transactional data ordering. Nowadays, it is envisioned as a powerful backbone/framework for decentralized data processing and datadriven self-organization in ﬂat, open-access networks. In particular, the plausible characteristics of decentralization, immutability and self-organization are primarily owing to the unique decentralized consensus mechanisms introduced by blockchain networks. This survey is motivated by the lack of a comprehensive literature review on the development of decentralized consensus mechanisms in blockchain networks. In this survey, we provide a systematic vision of the organization of blockchain networks. By emphasizing the unique characteristics of incentivized consensus in blockchain networks, our in-depth review of the state-ofthe-art consensus protocols is focused on both the perspective of distributed consensus system design and the perspective of incentive mechanism design. From a game-theoretic point of view, we also provide a thorough review on the strategy adoption for self-organization by the individual nodes in the blockchain backbone networks. Consequently, we provide a comprehensive survey on the emerging applications of the blockchain networks in a wide range of areas. We highlight our special interest in how the consensus mechanisms impact these applications. Finally, we discuss several open issues in the protocol design for blockchain consensus and the related potential research directions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Wenbo"},{"family":"Hoang","given":"Dinh Thai"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Peizhao"},{"family":"Xiong","given":"Zehui"},{"family":"Niyato","given":"Dusit"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Ping"},{"family":"Wen","given":"Yonggang"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Dong In"}],"container-title":"IEEE Access","container-title-short":"IEEE Access","DOI":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2896108","ISSN":"2169-3536","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"22328-22370","source":"arXiv.org","title":"A Survey on Consensus Mechanisms and Mining Strategy Management in Blockchain Networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.02707","volume":"7"},

We present ZZ, a new approach that reduces the replication cost of BFT services from 2f + 1 to practically f + 1. The key insight in ZZ is to use f + 1 execution replicas in the normal case and to activate additional replicas only upon failures. In data centers where multiple applications share a physical server, ZZ reduces the aggregate number of execution replicas running in the data center, improving throughput and response times. ZZ relies on virtualization—a technology already employed in modern data centers—for fast replica activation upon failures, and enables newly activated replicas to immediately begin processing requests by fetching state on-demand. A prototype implementation of ZZ using the BASE library and Xen shows that, when compared to a system with 2f + 1 replicas, our approach yields lower response times and up to 33% higher throughput in a prototype data center with four BFT web applications.

Three-dimensional network-configuration representative volume element models were built to investigate the thermal properties of these composites by applying a Monte Carlo, controllable, spatial distribution algorithm. The composites' thermal conductivity and volume resistance were also measured. Tribological tests were conducted using a ball-on-disk reciprocating friction and wear tester. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy were used to analyze the morphologies and elements of worn surfaces. The results showed that AlN/FG–PTSC possessed the best thermal properties, which were ascribed to a compact thermal conductive network; thermal conductivity was 88.8% and 44.8% greater than the highest value of AlN–PTSC and FG–PTSC, respectively.

  {"id":"YinEtAl2003","abstract":"We describe a new architecture for Byzantine fault tolerant state machine replication that separates agreement that orders requests from execution that processes requests. This separation yields two fundamental and practically significant advantages over previous architectures. First, it reduces replication costs because the new architecture can tolerate faults in up to half of the state machine replicas that execute requests. Previous systems can tolerate faults in at most a third of the combined agreement/state machine replicas. Second, separating agreement from execution allows a general privacy firewall architecture to protect confidentiality through replication. In contrast, replication in previous systems hurts confidentiality because exploiting the weakest replica can be sufficient to compromise the system. We have constructed a prototype and evaluated it running both microbenchmarks and an NFS server. Overall, we find that the architecture adds modest latencies to unreplicated systems and that its performance is competitive with existing Byzantine fault tolerant systems.","author":[{"family":"Yin","given":"Jian"},{"family":"Martin","given":"Jean-Philippe"},{"family":"Venkataramani","given":"Arun"},{"family":"Alvisi","given":"Lorenzo"},{"family":"Dahlin","given":"Mike"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2003]]},"title":"Separating Agreement from Execution for Byzantine Fault Tolerant Services","type":"report","URL":"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/lorenzo/papers/sosp03.pdf"},

To our knowledge, HotStu is the rst partially synchronous BFT replication protocol exhibiting these combined properties. HotStu is built around a novel framework that forms a bridge between classical BFT foundations and blockchains. It allows the expression of other known protocols (DLS, PBFT, Tendermint, Casper), and ours, in a common framework.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Yin","given":"Maofan"},{"family":"Malkhi","given":"Dahlia"},{"family":"Reiter","given":"Michael K."},{"family":"Gueta","given":"Guy Golan"},{"family":"Abraham","given":"Ittai"}],"container-title":"arXiv:1803.05069 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,23]]},"language":"en","source":"arXiv.org","title":"HotStuff: BFT Consensus in the Lens of Blockchain","title-short":"HotStuff","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05069"},
  {"id":"YuEtAl2018","abstract":"Existing proof-of-work cryptocurrencies cannot tolerate attackers controlling more than 50% of the network’s computing power at any time, but assume that such a condition happening is “unlikely”. However, recent attack sophistication, e.g., where attackers can rent mining capacity to obtain a majority of computing power temporarily, render this assumption unrealistic. This paper proposes RepuCoin, the first system to provide guarantees even when more than 50% of the system’s computing power is temporarily dominated by an attacker. RepuCoin physically limits the rate of voting power growth of the entire system. In particular, RepuCoin defines a miner’s power by its ‘reputation’, as a function of its work integrated over the time of the entire blockchain, rather than through instantaneous computing power, which can be obtained relatively quickly and/or temporarily. As an example, after a single year of operation, RepuCoin can tolerate attacks compromising 51% of the network’s computing resources, even if such power stays maliciously seized for almost a whole year. Moreover, RepuCoin provides better resilience to known attacks, compared to existing proof-of-work systems, while achieving a high throughput of 10000 transactions per second (TPS).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Yu","given":"Jiangshan"},{"family":"Kozhaya","given":"David"},{"family":"Decouchant","given":"Jeremie"},{"family":"Esteves-Verissimo","given":"Paulo"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"number":"239","source":"ePrint IACR","title":"RepuCoin: Your Reputation is Your Power","title-short":"RepuCoin","type":"report","URL":"http://eprint.iacr.org/2018/239"},
  {"id":"Zbierski2016","abstract":"In the last decade, numerous Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) replication protocols have been proposed in the literature. However, practically all of these solutions were designed and optimized only for certain, typically very limited set of environment conditions. Despite previous efforts, no existing BFT replication protocol can guarantee stable and reasonable performance in both correct and faulty environments. In this article we attempt to address this problem by introducing Supr, a novel method for effortlessly combining multiple replication protocols into adaptive BFT solutions, which accommodate to a much wider spectrum of environment conditions than the existing BFT systems. Unlike previous approaches, Supr uses a fine-grained mechanism to monitor the parameters of the execution environment, which enables detecting and counteracting arbitrary faults exhibited in the system. To demonstrate its potential, we use Supr to create a sample BFT solution combining three existing replication protocols, each optimized for different conditions. The performed experiments demonstrate that our approach not only significantly outperforms existing solutions in varying environment conditions, but also does not introduce an observable overhead in stable environments.","author":[{"family":"Zbierski","given":"Maciej"}],"collection-title":"Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing","container-title":"Dependability Engineering and Complex Systems","editor":[{"family":"Zamojski","given":"Wojciech"},{"family":"Mazurkiewicz","given":"Jacek"},{"family":"Sugier","given":"Jarosław"},{"family":"Walkowiak","given":"Tomasz"},{"family":"Kacprzyk","given":"Janusz"}],"ISBN":"978-3-319-39639-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","page":"571-581","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","source":"Springer Link","title":"Supr: Adaptive Byzantine Fault-Tolerant Replication","title-short":"Supr","type":"paper-conference"},
  {"id":"ZhangEtAl2018","abstract":"The recent explosion of interest in blockchain led to a plethora of researches on consensus algorithms. Compared with bitcoin-derived consensus mechanisms, Byzantine Fault-Tolerance (BFT) algorithms are more applicable for consortium blockchain. However, these algorithms work lies in the foundation that 3f + 1 nodes are required to tolerate only f faults, which results in high network traffic and cost. The hybrid fault model with Trusted Components (TC) assistance is proposed to reduce the minimum to 2f + 1 and improve overall performance. In this paper, we firstly introduce the basic principles of BFT algorithms based on the hybrid fault model. Then we analyze different TC abstractions and implementation scenarios, and express our own choices. The general framework for BFT algorithms design choices and the applications of this model in blockchain are also discussed. Therefore, this paper aims to provide guidance for reasonable design of efficient BFT algorithms and application of TC assistance mechanism.","author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Qichao"},{"family":"Qi","given":"Zhuyun"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Xiaoyou"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Lei","given":"Kai"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of 2018 1st IEEE International Conference on Hot Information-Centric Networking (HotICN 2018)","event":"HotICN 2018","ISBN":"978-1-5386-4870-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"title":"Research and Application of BFT Algorithms Based on the Hybrid Fault Model","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://hoticn.com/files/hoticnPapers/019-paper 37.pdf"},
